,1045 page Ram Mandir Verdict to be included in JNU syllabus to make students stay longer,,"The #AyodhyaVerdict is finally out.

,Donald Trump Says he Can Mediate On Ram Mandir Issue If Both Parties Agree,,"Soon after US President Donald Trump offered to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir issue a major part of the issue got resolved. With the abrogation of Article 370, India government has made J&K a Union Territory, thus removing the role of Pakistan in J&K and to further make Pakistan irrelevant, Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh said that there’s no need to talk to Pakistan and in case the talk happens it will happen only about PoK, Pakistan occupied Kashmir. Although, it was all about BJP led NDA government smartness and courage to resolve the Kashmir issue, Donald Trump is taking all the credit as the issue got resolved only after he offered to mediate. Seeing his as an omen, Hindu Maha Sabha has approached him to request him to offer to mediate, however, the other party Sunni Waqf Board is reluctant to get the matter resolved. Reportedly, Trump is likely to accept the offer of offering the mediation only if the case gets resolved without he actually meditating as it will save thousands of dollars when the world economy is looking not so positive. If sources are to be believed Trump may offer to mediate between Pakistan and Balchosutan too after Ram Mandir issue gets resolved. Details awaited.",0

,UN asks Pakistan to remove big trees after latter complains India planning bigger attack than Balakot,,"Rattled with Indian government’s decision of abolishing Article 370, Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been cooking up conspiracy stories to draw UN’s and US’s attention towards him. Pakistan, which claims PoK and Jammu & Kashmir as its own territory got a big blow when Home Minister Amit Shah passed the bill that scrapped Article 370. Since then Imran Khan is trying to target India at global level, and in one such desperate attempt, the Pakistani PM by mistake accepted that Indian Air Force did Balakot Air Strike and also complained that India is planning bigger attack than Balakot. However, Pakistan had earlier said that Balakot strike by India was a waste as it only uprooted a few trees. UN on Friday issued a statement answering Pakistan’s worry of attack by India. UN suggested Pakistan remove all the big trees or to shift them to some remote location so that when India does an attack bigger than Balakot there’s no loss of trees. While Pakistan is complying with the UN’s suggestion, Social media users are royally trolling Pakistan and its leaders. The detail on this is awaited.",0

Mumbai is even lower at 30 %. Mumbaikars gave various reasons for the low turnout. People in suburbs said that they have to go to office tomorrow so they have to catch a train today as the commute is way too long. Some said that they show their spirit only during heavy rains and as there is no rain today they won’t go out and vote. But the best reasons came from people who were protesting the metro construction at Aarey few days back.

After Kapil Mishra, Senior AAP leader Kumar Vishwas too tweeted hinting that Arvind Kejriwal has not only been physically assaulted by AAP MLAs but Kejriwal is injured to the extent that he isn’t able to walk anymore.

One of the users compared CM Arvind Kejriwal with Balakot, where Indian Air Force dropped bombs. “Arvind Kejriwal’s state has been reduced to that of the Balakot air strike area where no media is allowed access. After some time they will claim that nothing happened.” And In response to people’s accusations, Arvind Kejriwal has announced to upload a video where viewers can see him walking.

,"A Study By Leading Coffee Chain Roasta Coffee, Shows Coffee Is Very Good For Health",,"A well-known coffee chain with declining sales growth has recently conducted a study which proves that there’s no connection between coffee and increased risk of heart disease or cancer. The study also shows that people who die due to excess of caffeine in their body are simply unlucky because there are many with a higher amount of coffee in their body who are still living a good life. CEO John Panic spoke to The Fauxy, John said “Look, its stupid to blame everything on coffee. Coffee has been doing amazing things for people, it has also changed several lives, but we don’t get credit for that. Today you woke-up because of coffee, tomorrow you won’t, that’s as simple as that.” The study also shows that asking a girl out for coffee increases one’s chances of getting laid. A whopping 83% of youngsters get laid after asking girls for coffee whereas in case of Tea and other beverages the figure is below 10%. Although caffeine in your bloodstream causes the blood pressure to rise, nowadays it is quite common for almost every second person to have blood pressure related issues. Hence, the concept that coffee is not good for the heart is fundamentally flawed.",0

,"New Delhi: Man goes on fast and dharna in front of girlfriend’s house, finally convinces her to get married",,"It is a popular stereotype that New Delhi is a land of rallies, protest marches, processions, and dharnas. So far such things happened mostly for political or social activities, but this time it happened for love. Dharna and fasting for getting back love are rarely heard of, though this is precisely what happened in New Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal was in a relationship with a girl named Sunita for the last eight years. But recently, Sunita ended all communication with him. She had virtually become incommunicado over the phone, WhatsApp and other social media sites. Sensing something amiss, Arvind did some digging and found out that Sunita’s family is looking to get her married elsewhere. The prospective groom was about to visit Sunita’s home. Sensing that he has little time to get back love, Arvind started a fast cum dharna in front of Sunita’s house from Sunday. He was carrying a placard where it was written, ‘Give back my eight years’. Soon one-sided lovers got wind of this unique dharna and came out in support of Arvind. In the meanwhile, the family of the guy who was set to marry Sunita also arrived at the spot. Police too reached the dharna location but they couldn’t stop Arvind from keeping his fast to in order to get back his love. As the hours went on, Arvind’s health worsened and he was rushed to the hospital. Finally, Sunita agreed to marry her old boyfriend and after intervention from locals, her family also came around. Arvind and Sunita got married instantly and went to a local mandir to complete all rituals. Note: All characters and events depicted in this article are entirely fictitious. Any similarity to Delhi’s CM Arvind Kejriwal or his love life is purely coincidental.",0

,Muslim Man Converts to Hinduism To Demolish Modi’s “Hindu Can Never Be A Terrorist” Claim,,"Lok Sabha elections have entered its 7th and last phase and political leaders are still trying tooth and nail to polarise the electoral process. On Sunday, during a rally in a Muslim majority city, while addressing more than ten people, actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan claimed that Nathuram Godse was the first Hindu terrorist of Independent India. Earlier, while countering the ‘Hindutva Terrorism’ term infamously coined by the Congress party, PM Modi said in a roaring voice “A Hindu can never be a terrorist!”. Soon after his statement, the opposition started bringing out cases where a Hindu has done violence, although carefully excluding Rajiv Gandhi from the list. In a similar attempt, a Muslim man decided to convert to Hinduism right before joining ISIS so as to quash Modi’s claim that a Hindu can never be terrorist. If rumours are to be believed the Muslim man is also going to join RSS and demand the building of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya after conversion so that the opposition is also able to attack him using terms like ‘Sanghi’. More on this awaited.",0
,India “Post Payments” Bank: A Way To Lure Vijay Mallya And Nirav Modi?,,"On Saturday, Prime Minister Modi launched India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) with the aim of maximizing financial inclusiveness. Three lakh postmen and ‘Grameen Dak Sewaks’ with digital aids will take banking to the doorstep of every Indian. However, the scheme is conveniently named as “Post Payments” which raises concerns and suggests that the government has a bigger hidden agenda other than just financial inclusion. Finance experts believe that the name has been deliberately kept like this so as to lure loan defaulters like Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, who are currently absconding and showing no signs of coming back. Since such fugitives are always on the look for seeking more loans, the ‘Post Payments’ Bank will certainly excite them and they may consider returning to India. While on the domestic front, Congress leader Ahmed Patel has already expressed interest in opening an account with IPPB, which further confirms that economic offenders may easily take the bait. 2019’s General Election is nearing and PM Modi is doing all that it takes to bring all economic fugitives under one roof, i.e. Tihar.

A video footage that went viral on social media had a food delivery boy in Zomato eating out from packaged food containers. He was later fired and the internet gave mixed reactions to the incident. Where several users trolled Zomato, at the same time some users showed sympathy for the delivery boy who was allegedly hungry. However, a few became fans of Zomato after the incident, since it meant something different to them altogether. They were impressed by the company’s superior service of tasting the food before serving it. The delivery boy who lost his job has now been hired by government’s FSSAI, Food Safety and Standards Authority Of India, department. The delivery boy is currently under training department, where he’ll be training approximately 500 youngsters the art and etiquette of serving food. This shall involve checking the item’s temperature, the seasoning, ingredients etc. before serving it. Speaking to The Fauxy, FSSAI head said “Look the intent is more important in everything you do. When we interviewed him we realised that he never intended to eat the food but to check its quality. It’s important for us since we don’t have any machine or technology to verify the tasty food. Hence, we hired him.”",0

Therefore, some Christian organisations came together and requested the new prominent figure among Christians, Ranu Mondal, to speak on their behalf. Ranu Mondal decided to file a claim demanding some land in Ayodhya to be dedicated for Christians as well so that they can build a grand Church. She said that this will be a display of true secularism of India if Supreme Court allots some land to Christians. I will also request Sidhhu ji to come forward and demand some land for Gurudwara. The Fauxy tried to speak with Ranu but she said she has no time as she wanted to practice singing. We heard her calling her personal assistant saying, “aaaaaa aaaaaa”.",0

,"Zaira Wasim Quits Acting As Islam Forbids It, Asks Malala To Do The Same",,"It is not quite unusual for celebrities to quit their path to fame midway. While some people quit acting because they want to start a family or focus on their own selves, Dangal girl Zaira Wasim has an unusual reason behind this not so quite unusual career step. Zaira Wasim has quit films and acting as she feels that her relationship with her religion is threatened due to regular featuring on media house covers and getting crores for it. Ironically enough, after her retirement announcement, she was quick to become the talk of the town, thus threatening her relationship with her religion all the more. Back in the ’90s, country’s heartthrob Mamata Kulkarni had also adopted the peaceful ways of Islam and quit acting to marry her gangster boyfriend. She was never to been seen again. Maybe because of a Burkha and not because of her gangster husband. Moving on. As per Islam, acting or featuring in films is prohibited and amounts to ‘Haraam’. In order to safeguard her regressive religious views (because there’s always one person doing that), Zaira Wasim decided to take a retirement from her acting career. Not only this, she has come out to encourage Malala Yousafzai, the notorious Nobel Price laureate to quit her acting career too and follow the path of Allah. Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel laureate, with a half-paralysed face and no super-cool technology driven wheelchair like Stephen Hawking, managed to beat the latter and grab a Nobel Prize only for sheer acting. Given how Shahrukh and Salman Khan movies receive overwhelming openings in Pakistan, we’re not that surprised about her grabbing a Nobel Prize in acting. “She had delivered an actin sequence. How many times can an actor say that “I’ll take a bullet for this scene?” She literally took one!” said a member of the Nobel Prize Committee. Currently, it is not clear whether Malala has accepted Zaira Wasim’s offer or not, however, chances are there that Malala may continue her ‘act’ until she is rewarded the Inter-Galactic Peace Prize by some unwitting alien, too naive to see beyond method acting. More on this awaited.",0

,Economy Deliberately Slowed Down To Divert Attention From The Kashmir Issue,,"The current economic slowdown is diverting attention from the core issues of Kashmir alleged the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday.  Since the Union Budget was presented on 5th July, approximately Rs 13.7 lac crore has eroded from the Indian capital markets. People who invest in the stock market or have something to do with it are as a result paying no attention to the valley where additional 35000 paramilitary forces have been deployed.  Rahul Gandhi has blamed BJP of deliberately keeping the share market depressed so as to divert attention from what all is happening in Kashmir. He also alleged that Modi has asked big companies to downsize their employee strength so that no one notices India retaining PoK. “It’s a usual practice of BJP to do something un-important and outrageous to divert people’s attention from their failures. After losing the three states of Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Rajasthan, BJP won 2019 elections to divert people’s attention from the loss they made in these states!” said Rahul Gandhi in a press conference.

But the backlog which the government had due to various scams under the UPA rule made it a tough task. Demonetization and GST made sure that economy will take some more time to recover. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman dismissed the concerns related to the economy slowing down and took advice from various industrialists and economic advisors. All this while, Finance minister Nirmala was seen taking various measures but none was astute enough to bring the economy to the level where UPA had brought it down and after running out of the options to further ruin the economy, the minister decided to take help from Raghuram Rajan, the poster boy of economic crisis in India.

Hours after the decision, Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) started the chopping of trees in the area. However, those who are against the construction of Metro rail car-shed started gathering at Aarey to protest against the chopping of trees. Ironically, all these protestors came in their own individual cars. High Court had studied and analyzed the data before giving the judgement in the favor of Metro construction as it would reduce the carbon emission in total. Seeing that the surge in number of Save Aarey protestors is increasing the carbon emission as they come in their own high-end cars, Maharashtra government has decided to run special buses from different locations of the city to Aarey forest so that more people can come in small number of vehicles thereby reducing the carbon emission.",0

All this while Pakistan claimed that it has two Indian Pilots under his custody out of which the other one has been hospitalised as he suffered a lot of injuries after local Pakistani villagers beat him up. Later it was revealed that the second pilot was a Pakistan Air Force Pilot. He succumbed to his injuries a day later. Recently, a few residents of the village where the deceased pilot fell, claimed that the ghost of the second pilot is troubling them. “I was sleeping when he came and slapped me.

But Shashi Tharoor is always one step ahead. Now Mr Tharoor plans to use the 3-D hologram technology at various parties and hotels to reach over a thousand women at once. He will appear live, in 3-D to the desired location by the use of 3-D projectors which his team will not only provide but will set up too. Shashi Tharoor’s manager told The Fauxy that the use of hologram technology will enable Mr Tharoor to reach women he would not otherwise meet or see in some of the country’s most inaccessible corners. He also mentioned that after Article 370 repealed, the craze of Tharoor Ji has reached among Kashmiri women too. A majority of female fans of Shashi Tharoor believe that technology will play a vital role in extending his popularity. As a pilot project, he has given 25 hologram presence to parties and hotels, each drawing average number of 100 women. By the time all the hologram setup is completed, he will have access to more than 10,000 women at once. “I was happily surprised to see Mr Tharoor in the mirror standing right behind me when I was doing makeup, but when I turned to touch him I couldn’t. I was in Leela hotel so for once I thought it’s his soul and I was almost into tears. However, soon his manager came and told me about the technology. I am happy and thinking of getting married to his 3-D hologram image.”, said one of Tharoor’s female fans to the Fauxy.",0

After failing to reach to any conclusion, the ISIS has agreed to follow Maharashtra’s formula of 50:50 and two different persons will be given charge for two and a half year each. After Maharashtra election which didn’t give a clear mandate to any party, there’s a tussle going on between BJP and Shivsena for the CMship. The BJP is offering deputy CM post to Shiv Sena but Shiv Sena wants to follow the 50:50 formula, which inspired ISIS too.
In fact the 50:50 formula can be used at many other places. Husband will earn money for 50% duration of marriage and wife would earn for the rest 50%, this idea was given by a feminist.

A recent RTI appeal has bared that the disputed land comes under the case of a Benami property as it is not registered under Emperor Babur’s name as previously claimed by various related outfits. The revenue department has issued a show cause notice to a group that had previously claimed that the land belonged to Babur’s clan, asking them to produce the source of income details for Babur. If the claimants fail to produce sufficient evidence, then Babur shall be considered guilty of committing an offence under the purview of Benami Act and shall be punishable with harsh imprisonment. Everyone claiming to be the living descendant of Babur shall also be liable to a fine of around 25 per cent of the fair market value of the property. “We will celebrate the upcoming Diwali in Ram temple, and the penalty collected from Babur shall be used to build the Ram Mandir,” said Swamy, while addressing media on the eve of Dussehra at the Ramlila Maidan.",0

Two hours after the trailer was released on TED Talk’s official YouTube channel, more than a million people liked and commented on it.

,Congress Likely to Announce Karnataka Bandh Over Increased Fuel Taxes by Karnataka Government,,"Today, the Karnataka government increased the tax rates on petrol and diesel from an earlier 28.75% and 17.73% to 32% and 21% respectively. Congress who promised fuel price reduction within a minute of forming a government in Madhya Pradesh is quite upset with this decision and is likely to announce a Karnataka Bandh tomorrow. Karnataka is currently ruled by a Congress and JDS coalition. A few days back Congress convened a Bharat Bandh due to increasing fuel prices and the country witnessed a surge in incidents of violence. In one such case in Bihar, a girl of age less than ten died as she could not get an ambulance due to the traffic created by Congress workers. Understanding what the normal public goes through due to the increase in fuel prices, Congress is likely to fight for people’s right and announce a statewide Karnataka Bandh tomorrow, says a Congress official who wishes to remain anonymous. The Fauxy’s reliable sources say that the Karnataka government has raised the taxes on fuel to get sufficient funding in order to fight the upcoming general elections as a large chunk of the black money that Congress had was reduced to paper during demonetization.",0

,Modi Is Meditating To Hack EVM Via Telepathy; Alleges Arvind Kejriwal,,"A few days before election results and a day before the last phase of the election, PM Narendra Modi visited the Kedarnath temple on Saturday to offer prayers. After spending his morning in prayers and reviewing re-development projects in Kedarnath, PM Modi went for meditation at a holy cave near Kedarnath shrine in Uttarakhand. However, CM Arvind Kejriwal believes that it’s not just meditation but a bigger conspiracy to turn the results in his favour. Kejriwal alleged that Modi was meditating to hack EVM machines via telepathy. Arvind Kejriwal received instant support from several of his party and opposition leaders as well. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said that it was not the first time when Modi undertook such telepathic exercise. A few days before Balakot Air Strike he was spotted meditating and praying in a black dress. “It is now clear. He uses telepathy and black magic to bring results in his favour,” said Sisodia. Currently it is not clear whether or not the Election Commission shall take any action against PM Modi for indulging in occult practices after the imposition of Model Code Of Conduct. However, this is not the first time that PM Modi has used the occult sciences to persuade results in his favour. In 2014 elections, BJP supposedly won banking on a certain ‘Modi Magic’.

,PM Modi Took Advantage of Clouds and Used Pakistan’s Air Space to attend SCO summit,,"On 26th February, after the air strike by Indian Air Force (IAF) on a Jaish-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot, Pakistan shut down its air space entirely. Since then, it has only two air routes open. A few days back India requested Pakistan to let Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aircraft fly over its airspace. The aircraft was carrying PM Modi who was on his way to attend the SCO summit at Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan. However, India explored a better option later and decided not to use Pakistan’s airspace. Reportedly, Monsoon has hit Kerala and other southern parts of the country and is likely to hit the entire country in another two days. SCO summit which was scheduled for 13th and 14th June only meant that a cloudy weather was on the cards. The same was verified by the Indian Meteorological Department after studying disturbances in Tata Sky signals. PM Modi took advantage of these clouds and used Pakistan’s airspace without them knowing. Just like in the time of Balakot air strike, Pakistan’s radar couldn’t catch Modi’s Air crafts, which is way more technically advanced. PMO India took this decision after the Pakistan government unreasonably demanded a toll tax to allow India to use its airspace. More details on this awaited.",0

,Supreme Court To Form A Central Board of Meme Certification (CBMC) Soon,,"The recent arrest of Priyanka Sharma in West Bengal stirred social media users across the country. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ordered the prompt release of BJP worker Priyanka Sharma, who was arrested for sharing a meme of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Priyanka’s release would, however, be subject to her offering a written apology. After the Supreme Court’s direction, several lawyers across the nation pointed out how the decision in Priyanka Sharma’s case could be misused for arresting people for posting memes till they tender an apology. Therefore, the Supreme Court has also decided to form a Central Board of Meme Certification (CBMC) to review all matters related to memes, caricatures, gifs and funny videos. “As it is we are extremely occupied deciding important matters like the height of Janmasthami Matka, classification of chappals as sandals, interfering with Diwali celebrations and delaying the Ayodhya Ram Mandir verdict. We need a separate body for meme petitions,” said a judge. The Central Board of Meme Certification is expected to consist of 5 Trinamool Party members and headed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee herself. Later on, the body shall expand its jurisdiction to review standup shows and passing jokes as well. “If your joke is funny, you might be given a chance to be as famous as Priyanka Sharma.

Although, it was all about BJP led NDA government smartness and courage to resolve the Kashmir issue, Donald Trump is taking all the credit as the issue got resolved only after he offered to mediate. Seeing his as an omen, Hindu Maha Sabha has approached him to request him to offer to mediate, however, the other party Sunni Waqf Board is reluctant to get the matter resolved. Reportedly, Trump is likely to accept the offer of offering the mediation only if the case gets resolved without he actually meditating as it will save thousands of dollars when the world economy is looking not so positive.

After failing to reach to any conclusion, the ISIS has agreed to follow Maharashtra’s formula of 50:50 and two different persons will be given charge for two and a half year each. After Maharashtra election which didn’t give a clear mandate to any party, there’s a tussle going on between BJP and Shivsena for the CMship. The BJP is offering deputy CM post to Shiv Sena but Shiv Sena wants to follow the 50:50 formula, which inspired ISIS too.
In fact the 50:50 formula can be used at many other places. Husband will earn money for 50% duration of marriage and wife would earn for the rest 50%, this idea was given by a feminist.

Priyanka Vadra’s move of accompanying her husband stirred a fresh political debate since she’s occupying a political position now. Accompanying her husband for interrogation in a big scam would mean no less than supporting a scam herself. However, more than a political debate, the issue gave birth to a new couple’s goal. At a time when wives usually abandon their husband if the latter is guilty of any crime, Priyanka Gandhi has set the bar high. Liberal: If Robert Vadra distributed the looted money amongst the poor, I shall support Priyanka. Feminist: Priyanka shouldn’t only support Robert but also accompany females involved in a crime of the same intensity so as to prove that women are no less than men. Bollywood Enthusiast: Omg!

India played down the significance of the informal closed consultations held by the UNSC, with India’s UN envoy Syed Akbaruddin saying the abrogation of Article 370 was entirely an internal matter of India. But Imran being Imran tried hard to make the issue a global one. And he thinks that Pakistanis can literally fix everything, just like a cricket match. He was proved wrong by the UNSC and the world leaders. Imran is so worried about Kashmir being a part of India that he is not thinking about his 4th or 5th marriage also, which used to occupy his brain most of the times. UN has finally found a solution to Mr. Khan’s worries. Just like an able doctor, they have prescribed him a dose of Amit Shah, a dose that has treated people like Arvind Kejriwal, Owaissi, Mamta Banerjee and other irrational leaders. The dose has to be given immediately and the time and place should be decided bilaterally. It has asked India to give this treatment free of cost to the Pakistanis as they have no money.",0
,Muslim Law Board Seizes Supreme Court; Shariat Law Imposed,,"All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) organised a rally outside the Supreme Court of India yesterday. The rally involving more than 500 people took a violent turn when the gathered crowd overwhelmed security forces and tore down the Supreme Court and ended up waving a green flag at its top dome. A subsequent inquiry into the incident found no one guilty. SC has often been accused of being biased in favour of one particular community while passing judgements. The Supreme Court has also been interfering in Hindu festivals and simultaneously turning a blind eye to the wrong practices of other religions. Sources say that it is this policy of minority appeasement that might have encouraged these Sharia lawmakers to take complete control and overthrow the highest judicial forum in India. “SC has all the time in the world to decide the height limit of Dahi Handi but views Muharram processions as safe. This means that it is already under our control, therefore, we just established a formal cognizance of our authority by waving our flag on it. What’s the harm? said Abul-ul-Bakaiti, a Sharia law student. The newly captured Supreme Court shall first take up Ayodhya’s Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid case in a fast-track manner and by the looks of it, the verdict is quite predictable.",0

Imran Khan is worried that before every election in India there will be terrorists killed in Pakistan and Pakistani Army will have to suffer. He today gave a statement that he supports the government’s ‘One Nation One Election’ demand, and wants the opposition also to support it. He will soon meet Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to discuss it further. The relation between Imran and Indian opposition is pretty good and they listen to everything that he says. Imran is sure that if there is only one election in India than Indian Army will attack the terrorists only once every 5 years and they will get a chance to defend themselves. It will be nice to hear the comments of Indian army chief on the same and we await his response.",0

The biscuit manufacturer says that it might have to lay off 10,000 employees if the trend continues. Recently, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was spotted making tea at a tea stall. Several economic experts have linked this incident with the low sales of Parle G biscuits. In Indian households, Parle G biscuits have been age-old partners with tea. Being complementary goods, the sales of one directly affects the other. After Mamata Banerjee’s publicity stunt, the overall market value of tea has declined, with several tea stalls in Bengal going bankrupt overnight! “Didi jabse chai banaya hai, logon ko lagra hai ki hum zeher bech raha hai. Koi chai peena hi hi nahi maangta ab!” said one tea vendor at Howrah Railway Station. Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was a tea-seller at an early age, has inspired many with his success story. However, Mamata’s act of mimicking the Prime Minister in order to garner attention has brought her into a negative light, especially for Parle G fans. “Chaiwaali kya bani ab apun ka favourite biscuit pe panuati laga daali na! ab apun kabhi bhi chai nahi pee paega na Parle G kha paega!” said Chotu Shaana, a cobbler at Mumbai Railway station. While the liberals are blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an economic slowdown, the economic experts have it clear that it is Maamata to blame. In another news, a team of youngsters from Delhi have approached the West Bengal Chief Minister to start appearing in TikTok videos so as to destroy their business as well.",0

However, Taimur believes that SC shouldn’t stop here and continuously keep taking a bold stand by further scrapping Article 370 and 35A, which would ensure further freedom to our brother and sisters in Kashmir.

,Election Commission Bans Highlights Of 2011 World Cup Finals,,"Ace cricketer Gautam Gambir is all set to make his political debut. On Monday, BJP fielded former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir from the East Delhi constituency. Gautam Gambhir who has a remarkable cricketing career is popularly known for his aggression on the field. Soon after he was given a ticket, his fans started uploading the videos of his outstanding cricketing shots thus giving him an edge over his political opponents as we all know that India is a cricket loving nation. One user uploaded Gambhir’s world cup final knock that led India to win the world cup after 28 years. The video got over a million shares, therefore giving a clear advantage to Gambhir. Later in the day, a petitioner approached the Election Commission asking them to take down the video as it was influencing the elections in BJP’s favour. The Election Commission in response submitted a report to the Supreme Court and claimed that the highlights of 2011 World Cup finals in which Gambhir has played an exceptional inning holds the capacity to “tilt the electoral balance”. A committee set up by the polling commission watched the entire match and submitted a report, which turns out not to be in BJP’s favour. The committee said that the match highlights “produces a political environment where an individual acquired cult status” and showing the highlights of the match when the Model Code of Conduct is in place would favour a particular political party. The report had said the screening of the movie should not be allowed until May 12th, the date of polling in Delhi. Currently, it is not clear whether the Election Commission is considering to ban the premiere of ‘Gadar’ on Zee Cinema – a movie that rightly shows Congress’ candidate Amisha Patel as a Pakistani and BJP’s candidate Sunny Deol in a “toxic hyper-nationalistic” role. More on this awaited.",0

Pakistan has alerted all security units and military. The military which faced embarrassment in Balakot is continuously tracking India’s GDP numbers to calculate the exact timings of the attacks. Nirmala Sitharaman has not yet accepted the fact that there is an economic slowdown and that is a worry for Pakistan.

Every day there’s cross border firing taking the lives of many on both sides. However, Pakistan did not expect India’s retaliation and that’s the reason Pakistan it is in under a panic mode. A tyre bust in the capital city of Islamabad further aggravated the already worse situation. Every loud sound in Pakistan is triggering fear in the minds of the populace and people are running to hide under their bed for safety, seeing which Pakistan’s government announced a blanket ban on all the items that produce a loud sound. Pakistani awam is likely to go against the government’s order since banning loud sound would also mean banning of loudspeakers at Mosques. Whether it’s surgical strike after the Uri attack or Air Strikes after Pulwama attack, India always selects early mornings for their attack, just a few hours before Pakistani awam offer the first prayer of the day. This decision will tremendously hurt religious sentiments. Sonu Nigam has come out to appreciate Pakistan government’s move and has requested the Indian government to follow the suit.",0

,Nirmala Sitharaman runs out of options to ruin the economy further; takes advice from Raghuram Rajan,,"India’s economy is in doldrums and Finance Minister is majorly dependent on the private sector to boost the economy and create jobs. But that’s not happening anytime soon. Modi government’s first tenure imposed several measures to ensure the economy grows faster by coming down hard on the NPAs. But the backlog which the government had due to various scams under the UPA rule made it a tough task. Demonetization and GST made sure that economy will take some more time to recover. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman dismissed the concerns related to the economy slowing down and took advice from various industrialists and economic advisors. All this while, Finance minister Nirmala was seen taking various measures but none was astute enough to bring the economy to the level where UPA had brought it down and after running out of the options to further ruin the economy, the minister decided to take help from Raghuram Rajan, the poster boy of economic crisis in India.

,.@ShashiTharoor’s Book “Why I Am A Hindu” Found In A Book Store’s Fiction Section,,"Shashi Tharoor enjoys controversy’s company and this time he’s welcoming it uninvited. A bookstore in Gurgaon has unknowingly trolled Shashi Tharoor, an author and Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram. Shashi Tharoor’s book Why I Am A Hindu was placed at the fiction section of the bookstore. Although the book was later placed to its correct place by then the image was already doing rounds on social media. Shashi Tharoor later filed a police complaint against the bookstore manager, who claimed to be innocent and ignorant about the book placement. CCTV footage revealed that a man, Ashok Mishra, 48, deliberately changed the book’s place and then also took a selfie with it. Police have managed to nab the wrongdoer and are currently interrogating him. Ashok in his defence cited various reasons for doing that. Ashok who is a big fan of Vivekananda believes that Shashi Tharoor isn’t right Hindu to be admired. Ashok says “no one has understood Hinduism better than Vivekananda and every statement of his is should be considered as truth without a doubt. However, Shashi Tharoor doesn’t seem to follow any of his sayings. Vivekananda said a Hindu shouldn’t become Christian and a Christian shouldn’t become Hindu, every religion has its own way of reaching the divine, however, Shashi Tharoor has never spoken a single word against the forced conversion. Vivekananda said that Hindus believe that we all are children of immortal bliss and Hindus refuses to call someone sinner whereas Shashi Tharoor tried to divided Hindus among Good Hindu and Bad Hindu. Ashok further added “Although Vivekananda rose above idol worship he never discouraged or questioned people who do idol worship he understood that it’s a way to reach divine- Yoga of devotion. Shashi Tharoor not only questioned the need of Ram Mandir but also called people Bad Hindu who demand Ram Mandir.” Currently, Ashok is under judicial custody",0

The state government made such 3D paintings on the roads at various locations to caution fast-driving riders. Alleging that this is a cheating and fraud by the government, the biker’s family has filed a fraud case against the government and demanded compensation for the same. Speaking to The Fauxy, the government official told, “3D paintings are cost-effective and are as equally efficient as speed breakers. However, there are some totally retard people who fall for 3D paintings too. And we consider this as our real success in making 3D paintings look real as fuck”.  It’s not the first case though.

The map displayed by China’s Ministry of Commerce gave a big boost to the incumbent BJP government. This news came in when the 2019 Lok Sabha election is at its peak and as it turns out, it is helping sway voters to decide their votes. Indian liberals have come out to declare it as a clear violation of model code of conduct. A group of liberals signed a document which was submitted to the Election Commission and a copy of the same was sent to China’s Ministry of Commerce. The letter appeals China to keep Arunachal Pradesh with them at least till the elections get over, thereby not giving an edge to the BJP. “BJP has already made the election an issue of nationalism and border security. Now if during the elections, China surrenders to India, it will give a clear edge to BJP. This should be considered as a violation of the model code of conduct,” said Prashant Bhooshan.",0
,Shashi Tharoor to use 3-D hologram technology to entertain multiple women at once,,"With more than 1000 women dying to meet and with only 24 hours in a day to reach and entertain them, Shashi Tharoor had a hard job deciding whom to meet and spend time with. But Shashi Tharoor is always one step ahead. Now Mr Tharoor plans to use the 3-D hologram technology at various parties and hotels to reach over a thousand women at once. He will appear live, in 3-D to the desired location by the use of 3-D projectors which his team will not only provide but will set up too. Shashi Tharoor’s manager told The Fauxy that the use of hologram technology will enable Mr Tharoor to reach women he would not otherwise meet or see in some of the country’s most inaccessible corners. He also mentioned that after Article 370 repealed, the craze of Tharoor Ji has reached among Kashmiri women too. A majority of female fans of Shashi Tharoor believe that technology will play a vital role in extending his popularity. As a pilot project, he has given 25 hologram presence to parties and hotels, each drawing average number of 100 women. By the time all the hologram setup is completed, he will have access to more than 10,000 women at once. “I was happily surprised to see Mr Tharoor in the mirror standing right behind me when I was doing makeup, but when I turned to touch him I couldn’t. I was in Leela hotel so for once I thought it’s his soul and I was almost into tears. However, soon his manager came and told me about the technology. I am happy and thinking of getting married to his 3-D hologram image.”, said one of Tharoor’s female fans to the Fauxy.",0

The most awaited case, i.e. the Ram Mandir land dispute, is also likely to get impacted since the Supreme Court is no more a trustworthy body for the Congress and particularly thr Gandhi Family. If sources are to be believed one of the prominent Congress leaders and lawyer has proposed a JPC ( Joint Parliamentary Committee) for the Ram Mandir issue too. This will not only expedite the case but shall also prove that Congress is not purposely delaying the verdict. “After the Rafale verdict, Congress is left with no political issue to hue and cry about and a demand for JPC is the only way to make headlines,” revealed a senior Congress leader who bears resemblance to Peter Pettigrew.",0

What is now being viewed as Modi government’s huge global diplomatic win is being considered as a massive poll violation by many, including the Congress. However, this time, instead of attacking the BJP, Congress has decided to file a complaint with EC against the UN itself! “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an influential leader. He has the capacity to get anything done through global institutions like the World Bank, IMF and now the United Nations! He is influencing the elections in BJP’s favour,” said Randeep Singh Surjewala. Burkha Dutt, a terrorist sympathizer and a Pakistan favourite spoke out against the decision, as expected. “It is clear that in its bid to win, BJP can do anything, even if it means catching terrorists or killing them off. This is atrocious and a total disregard of poll rules” she tweeted. Currently, it is not clear whether the Election Commission will consider Congress’ complaint against the UN, as they have been turning a deaf ear to all kinds of poll violations in West Bengal too.

However, the role of the Election Commission did not end since the results were pending until 23rd May. Today as counting progressed the country gave a clear mandate to BJP, thus sending a strong message that the public is indeed happy with the incumbent Modi government. Soon after exit polls, opposition leaders started with their concocted lies and EVM drama as usual, but to no avail as nor voters nor the Election Commission bought their argument. The opposition fought the election on self-manifested issues like ‘Democracy is in Danger’ and ‘Secularism is in danger’ to name a few. In one such issue, opposition leaders, especially Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP claimed that if in case the Modi-Shah duo does win, then this shall be the last ever elections that India will witness. The same prophecy was seen turning true as EVM machines were found selling on the OLX website. Reportedly, BJP is likely to bid a farewell to the Election Commission too and the office which is presently occupied by the ECI shall be taken over by the BJP and converted into a secondary headquarter.

Imran Khan thinks that India might attack Pakistan to divert the attention from the GDP numbers. In fact, Imran Khan is saying it in world forums that India’s GDP is much better than what it looks so that he can convince the Indian government that there is no need of attention diversion. Pakistan has alerted all security units and military. The military which faced embarrassment in Balakot is continuously tracking India’s GDP numbers to calculate the exact timings of the attacks. Nirmala Sitharaman has not yet accepted the fact that there is an economic slowdown and that is a worry for Pakistan. It means that India will surely attack now as it cannot counter the press anymore. Pakistan has wrote letter to many countries to give them cover for security out of which only China has replied in affirmative that too after putting Pakistan into more debt.",0

Soon after the attack defence journalists from different countries started demanding proofs but to no avail since Pakistan’s PM Imran Khan closed down the city for reasons best known to him. However, after a month Pakistan allowed journalists to visit, investigate and verify Indian Air Force’s claims of dropping KGs of bombs at the Balakot site. With hundreds of defence journalists going to Balakot, it has now become Pakistan’s most toured town by foreigners. Pakistan is infamous for giving shelter to terrorists and that’s one of the reasons foreigners are no more willing to go to Pakistan. On Wednesday, Imran Khan addressed the nation and announced that Balakot is now the most favoured tourist destination of the country. He also said that Pakistan will soon create the environment conducive for tourism. Many Indian journalists are mocking India after this, since what begun as an action against terroristan, has instead given a boost to its economy.",0

,"SC likely to auction Ayodhya’s disputed land, Mukesh Ambani to bid.",,"The famous political, historical and socio-religious debate is likely to end soon. The long-disputed land of Ayodhya will finally have an owner. After years and years of mindless quarrels among religious parties, the Ayodhya debate is finally getting solved and that too fairly amicably. Quite anti-climatic, right? Sources say that the Supreme Court is going to auction the disputed land of Ayodhya and the money earned through this auction might be utilized for revamping the Supreme Court and other courts of the country. Whether there will be Ram Mandir or a Babri Masjid at the spot, is still a mystery. However, observing the support extended by big business tycoons to PM Modi, it is not very difficult to guess the destiny of the disputed land. Mukesh Ambani, the current richest Indian, has shown his willingness to bid at the aforementioned auction. However, he hasn’t disclosed about his intentions and there is high speculation on what he’s going to build there. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar appealed to a certain special community to withdraw their claim over the Ayodhya land, pointing out that if the Ram Mandir issue is not solved, India will soon turn into Syria. This particular comment seems to have caught the attention of certain cults within JNU, who are hell-bent on forming the next ISIS in our nation. As a result, a group of over-age students from JNU were spotted chanting “Ambani tere tukde honge” in front of Ambani’s place of residence, Antilia. Sources also say that SC has summoned CM Arvind Kejriwal to know if he’s willing to bid. Arvind Kejriwal has submitted his response to SC stating “Arre hum to chote aadmi hain ji, hamari kya aukaat!” After recording his statement, SC has allegedly sought another confirmation letter from Kejriwal saying, “Haan isiliye poocha! Aap likhit confirmation submit kare. Baad me mat bolna ki Ambani ko de diya!” Political experts and psephologists believe that verdict of Ayodhya dispute would play an important role in 2019 general elections and that’s why the ruling party wants to conclude it before the General Elections, whereas opposition is trying to defer it as much as they can.

,Maharashtra Government To Start Doorstep Delivery Of Cigarettes,,"Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis today announced that the state government shall soon roll out a scheme wherein cigarette packets of popular brands will conveniently reach the doorsteps of citizens. The decision came after a recent episode where a model named Megha Sharma stripped down to bare minimums after her cold-hearted watchman refused to arrange cigarettes for her. This lead to a totally unavoidable spat which ended up in an emotionally upsetting experience for the model. The Maharashtra Government was quick to take cognizance and thus announced a novel service called ‘Hukkah Paani’ aka Home Delivery of Cigarettes from 1st January 2019. In its initial run, the project proposes to deliver cigarette packets at the doorstep of various prominent locations in Mumbai such as Lokhandwala, Worli, Bandra, Colaba etc. In the second phase, which is likely to be launched by March 2019, customers can also avail the benefit of getting loose cigarette delivered at their doorstep. Soon after the incident, Mumbai Police officers displayed a never before agility in their actions and went ahead to arrest the watchman, even if it meant leaving partially created memes halfway behind. The watchman is currently under police custody and the cops are trying hard to make him admit the allegations. In another news, Megha Sharma was recently signed up by an ad agency to replace ‘Mukesh’ in theatrical infomercials warning people against smoking.",0

BJP has been seen making a huge dent in TMC’s vote share, and recently a rally of PM Modi had to be called off midway when a stampede-like situation arose due to a heavy gathering. BJP President Amit Shah was also seen targeting Mamata Banerjee for appeasement politics and for making West Bengal a hub of illegal immigrants. CM Mamata Banerjee has transformed West Bengal into a mini-Syria through her appeasement politics. Recently the helicopters of Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath were not allowed to land and today CBI officials were arrested by the West Bengal Police.",0

,Supreme Court To Form A Central Board of Meme Certification (CBMC) Soon,,"The recent arrest of Priyanka Sharma in West Bengal stirred social media users across the country. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ordered the prompt release of BJP worker Priyanka Sharma, who was arrested for sharing a meme of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Priyanka’s release would, however, be subject to her offering a written apology. After the Supreme Court’s direction, several lawyers across the nation pointed out how the decision in Priyanka Sharma’s case could be misused for arresting people for posting memes till they tender an apology. Therefore, the Supreme Court has also decided to form a Central Board of Meme Certification (CBMC) to review all matters related to memes, caricatures, gifs and funny videos. “As it is we are extremely occupied deciding important matters like the height of Janmasthami Matka, classification of chappals as sandals, interfering with Diwali celebrations and delaying the Ayodhya Ram Mandir verdict. We need a separate body for meme petitions,” said a judge. The Central Board of Meme Certification is expected to consist of 5 Trinamool Party members and headed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee herself. Later on, the body shall expand its jurisdiction to review standup shows and passing jokes as well. “If your joke is funny, you might be given a chance to be as famous as Priyanka Sharma. And if its really really funny, your name could even be taken during the Parliamentary proceedings!” said Brien, who is expected to be a prominent meme-inspector.",0

Kashmir which is known for youngsters with a budding talent for becoming global terrorists is slowly losing its grip to Pakistan in the terror industry. Aslam, a 21-year-old boy from the valley realised that he was not entirely convinced with the ISIS ideology. He now wants his father to become a school headmaster just in case he gets convinced and joins Jihad at a later stage in his life. “Aslam is looking for a career switch and in recent times ISIS, JEM, LET etc have shown maximum openings that too in top positions. Although currently, he is not very eager to join any of such organisations, if he fails to get a decent job, then being a headmaster’s son will save his image. That’s why he has been forcing me to join any school or madrasa as a headmaster,” said Aslam’s father. Aslam also cited the example of Burhan Wani who was projected as the son of school headmaster by Barkha Dutt. “Burhan Vani was a terrorist and he killed many innocent people but see how hundreds came to his funeral and how he was made into a hero, only because he was the son of a school headmaster. Once my father becomes a headmaster, my career options shall open up. I’ll be living my own life without any guilt,” said Aslam.",0

,Omprakash Mishra Files Copyright Case Against Gully Boy After Seeing Rapper Ranveer Singh,,"Big trouble for Ranveer Singh and producers of the movie Gully Boy, whose trailer got aired on Wednesday. The movie Gully Boy is based on the life of a street rapper. Although Ranveer Singh has stunned the audience with his performance in the one and half minute trailer, even in his wildest dreams he wouldn’t have expected that this stunning performance would invite trouble for him. Famous rapper and YouTube sensation, Omprakash Mishra has filed a copyright violation and plagiarism case against the producers, Farhan Akhtar, Zoya Akhtar and Ritesh Sherwani. Another famous singer and youtube sensation Dhinchak Pooja has come out in support of Omprakash Mishra. Dhinchak Pooja said “Bollywood sala chor hai..they once made a movie on my life and didn’t give me royalty or credit” supposedly referring to the movie Secret Superstar. Court has accepted Omprakash’s plea and is likely to hold the release of the movie “Gully Boy” until it gets cleared whether the movie is based upon his life or not. In case it is, then the producers will have to pay a royalty fee to Omprakash Mishra. Considering that millions of people are waiting for the movie and any delay would hurt the sentiments of Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt’s fanbase, Courts are likely to set an early date for the hearing by further delaying the Ram Mandir hearing.",0
