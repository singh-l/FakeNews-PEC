China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Imran Khan, the Pakistani prime minister, used a televised address to call for dialogue to prevent more reprisals, making reference to both countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith the weapons you have and the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation?\u201d Khan said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we think that, if this escalates, what will it lead to?\u201d</p> \n<p>Pakistan has released footage purportedly showing one of the captured Indian pilots, a wing commander who gave his name as Abhinandan.

One wreckage fell on our side and another wreckage fell on their side.\u201d</p> \n<p>He told the Guardian after the briefing that Pakistan had not entered Indian airspace. \u201cWe want to send the message that we have the ability to strike, the capability for self defence, but in the way of a responsible nation,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But India rejected his account. \u201c[Pakistan] used its air force to target military installation on the Indian side,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cDue to a high state of readiness and alertness Pakistan\u2019s attempt were foiled successfully. The Pakistan air force was a detected and the Indian air force responded instantly.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn that aerial engagement one Pakistan fighter airplane was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian air force. The Pakistan airplane was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pakistan has denied losing an aircraft in the morning\u2019s engagements.</p> \n<p>In a national address on Wednesday afternoon, Khan called for talks between Delhi and Islamabad. \u201cI will tell you again that better sense should prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should sit down and resolve our problems through dialogue.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another Indian aircraft crashed about 150km away in Budgam district on Wednesday, killing at least one person aboard, but it was unrelated to the fighting.</p> \n<p>India has been on high alert since Tuesday\u2019s strikes, an operation Islamabad had promised to repay with its own \u201csurprise\u201d attack.</p> \n<p>Fighter jets patrolled the skies above Srinagar, the capital of disputed Kashmir, throughout Tuesday night as India and Pakistan traded mortar fire a few hundred miles away at the ceasefire border.</p> \n<p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, issued a statement largely supportive of India, characterising its incursion five miles into neighbouring territory a \u201ccounter terrorism action\u201d and calling on Pakistan to take \u201cmeaningful action against terrorist groups operating on its soil\u201d.</p> \n<p>There are still significant questions over what, if anything, was struck by India\u2019s fighter jets in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Both countries agree that Indian jets made it to within at least a few miles of Balakot, a small city about five miles inside Pakistani territory. But accounts diverge from there.</p> \n<p>India claims it hit a militant training camp and killed \u201ca very large number\u201d of fighters from the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) group, which took responsibility for a 14 February suicide bombing in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitaries.</p> \n<p>Pakistan says the Indian fighters were confronted before they could reach Balakot and dropped four to five bombs in an open field as they fled back across the border.</p> \n<p>Both countries mounted media blitzes to push their particular narrative but had appeared to leave room to de-escalate the conflict.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday morning, India\u2019s external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj, emphasised that Pakistan\u2019s military was not the target of the sorties.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo military installations were targeted,\u201d Swaraj said. \u201cThe limited objective of the pre-emptive strike was to act decisively against the terrorist infrastructure of the JeM in order to pre-empt another terrorist attack in India.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cIndia does not wish see further escalation of the situation and India will continued to act with responsibility and restraint.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pakistan is holding a joint session of parliament on Wednesday afternoon followed by a meeting of the National Command Authority, whose responsibilities include overseeing the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is your turn now to wait and get ready for our surprise,\u201d Ghafoor said on Tuesday night.</p> \n<p>Both armies accused the other of shelling villages and opposition army posts across the line of control that separates Indian and Pakistani controlled Kashmir.</p> \n<p>A Pakistani police official told the Associated Press that six people were killed by Indian mortar attacks.

Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday morning that it had struck \u201cnon-military target[s]\u201d across the ceasefire line in Kashmir without entering Indian airspace to demonstrate its \u201cright, will and capability for self defence\u201d. \u201cWe have no intention of escalation, but are fully prepared to do so if forced into that paradigm,\u201d said Mohammad Faisal, the foreign affairs ministry\u2019s spokesman. Ghafoor told a media briefing on Wednesday afternoon Pakistan struck six targets on the Indian side of the ceasefire line, ensuring they kept a safe distance away from civilian, administrative or military sites. \u201cWhen PAF [Pakistan Air Force] took targets, IAF\u2019s [Indian Air Force] two planes violated the line of control and entered Pakistan,\u201d he said. \u201cPAF was ready, there was an engagement and as a result both Indian planes were shot down. One wreckage fell on our side and another wreckage fell on their side.\u201d He told the Guardian after the briefing that Pakistan had not entered Indian airspace. \u201cWe want to send the message that we have the ability to strike, the capability for self defence, but in the way of a responsible nation,\u201d he said. But India rejected his account. \u201c[Pakistan] used its air force to target military installation on the Indian side,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cDue to a high state of readiness and alertness Pakistan\u2019s attempt were foiled successfully. The Pakistan air force was a detected and the Indian air force responded instantly. \u201cIn that aerial engagement one Pakistan fighter airplane was shot down by a MiG 21 Bison of the Indian air force. The Pakistan airplane was seen by ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side.\u201d Pakistan has denied losing an aircraft in the morning\u2019s engagements. In a national address on Wednesday afternoon, Khan called for talks between Delhi and Islamabad. \u201cI will tell you again that better sense should prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should sit down and resolve our problems through dialogue.\u201d Another Indian aircraft crashed about 150km away in Budgam district on Wednesday, killing at least one person aboard, but it was unrelated to the fighting. India has been on high alert since Tuesday\u2019s strikes, an operation Islamabad had promised to repay with its own \u201csurprise\u201d attack. Fighter jets patrolled the skies above Srinagar, the capital of disputed Kashmir, throughout Tuesday night as India and Pakistan traded mortar fire a few hundred miles away at the ceasefire border. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, issued a statement largely supportive of India, characterising its incursion five miles into neighbouring territory a \u201ccounter terrorism action\u201d and calling on Pakistan to take \u201cmeaningful action against terrorist groups operating on its soil\u201d. There are still significant questions over what, if anything, was struck by India\u2019s fighter jets in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Both countries agree that Indian jets made it to within at least a few miles of Balakot, a small city about five miles inside Pakistani territory. But accounts diverge from there. India claims it hit a militant training camp and killed \u201ca very large number\u201d of fighters from the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) group, which took responsibility for a 14 February suicide bombing in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 40 paramilitaries. Pakistan says the Indian fighters were confronted before they could reach Balakot and dropped four to five bombs in an open field as they fled back across the border. Both countries mounted media blitzes to push their particular narrative but had appeared to leave room to de-escalate the conflict. On Wednesday morning, India\u2019s external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj, emphasised that Pakistan\u2019s military was not the target of the sorties. \u201cNo military installations were targeted,\u201d Swaraj said. \u201cThe limited objective of the pre-emptive strike was to act decisively against the terrorist infrastructure of the JeM in order to pre-empt another terrorist attack in India.\u201d She added: \u201cIndia does not wish see further escalation of the situation and India will continued to act with responsibility and restraint.\u201d Pakistan is holding a joint session of parliament on Wednesday afternoon followed by a meeting of the National Command Authority, whose responsibilities include overseeing the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal. \u201cIt is your turn now to wait and get ready for our surprise,\u201d Ghafoor said on Tuesday night. Both armies accused the other of shelling villages and opposition army posts across the line of control that separates Indian and Pakistani controlled Kashmir. A Pakistani police official told the Associated Press that six people were killed by Indian mortar attacks. Indian security officials did not report any casualties but said villages were hit including Kamalkote and Kalgo, both near the heavily guarded military border. Two militants allegedly belonging to JeM were shot dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir Shopain district on Wednesday morning, in the fourth counter-insurgency operation since a car laden with explosives was detonated by an Indian paramilitary convoy, sparking the latest round of tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Markets and shops across Kashmir were shut on Wednesday in protest at the arrests of hundreds of separatist activists and leaders in the days before Tuesday\u2019s military operations.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tuesday\u2019s attacks followed nearly a fortnight of sabre-rattling between the pair over the southern Kashmir suicide bombing, in which India has claimed Pakistan had a \u201cdirect hand\u201d.

Tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours have escalated in recent weeks with the killing of 40 Indian security personnel in a suicide bombing, and now Tuesday\u2019s airstrike \u2013 the first such attack by India since it went to war with Pakistan in 1971. India\u2019s foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, called the attack \u201ca pre-emptive strike\u201d after receiving credible intelligence that the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which was behind the recent suicide bombing, was training fighters for similar attacks at the site. Imran Khan, the Pakistani prime minister, said India\u2019s claim that it had hit a terrorist training camp at Balakot was \u201ca self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim\u201d. \u201cThis action has been done for domestic consumption in the election environment, putting regional peace and stability at grave risk,\u201d Khan said, referring to India\u2019s general election which starts in two months. Pakistan\u2019s armed forces spokesman, Maj-Gen Asif Ghafoor,said a joint session of Pakistan\u2019s parliament would be held on Wednesday, followed by a meeting of the National Command Authority, whose responsibilities include overseeing the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal.

Islamabad released pictures on social media showing uprooted trees and cratered soil, which it claimed was the extent of the damage from the Indian bombing. Local media in Pakistan as well as Reuters quoted residents of Balakot who said they heard four to five blasts overnight which damaged homes and left large pockmarks in the ground. The conflicting narratives over the attack echo India\u2019s claims in September 2016 it sent special forces to destroy militant facilities over the ceasefire border \u2013 an attack that Pakistan still maintains never happened. The opposing positions allowed India to trumpet its reprisal against Pakistan without forcing Islamabad to respond in a way that might spiral into a larger conflict. Indian ministers lauded the airstrikes. \u201cIt was an act of extreme valour,\u201d said Prakash Javadekar, the human resources development minister, in the first official acknowledgement of the operation.
