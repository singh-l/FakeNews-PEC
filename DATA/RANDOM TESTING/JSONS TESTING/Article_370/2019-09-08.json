Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC\u2019s general secretary, called upon parliament not to budge until an extension to article 50 has been secured. It follows a standoff between parliament and the government over Johnson\u2019s plan to leave the EU on 31 October, come what may. Speaking at the first day of the TUC\u2019s annual congress, O\u2019Grady said MPs must force an extension before relinquishing control of the Brexit process. \u201cMy advice to MPs is this: when you\u2019ve got your opponent on the ropes \u2013 don\u2019t let them off.

A no-deal Brexit would pave the way for a low-tax, low-regulation Britain that works for hedge fund managers but offers nothing for working people,\u201d O\u2019Grady added. The TUC will debate their own Brexit policy on Sunday afternoon, with some of the biggest unions still split over the direction of the Labour movement. While many unions would like the TUC to push for a second referendum in which they campaigned to remain, others, including the fire brigades\u2019 union, the communication workers\u2019 union and Unite\u2019s leader Len McCluskey have argued against this. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour\u2019s leader, is due to address the congress on Tuesday, followed by the shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer\u2019s appearance on Wednesday.",
