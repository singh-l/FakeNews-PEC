A resourceful girl gang of exotic dancers sets out to \u201cfleece\u201d New York\u2019s sleaziest fat cats, drugging their drinks and running up their credit card bills in an act of feminist liberation from both men and The Man. The year is 2007 and top-tier scumbags are coming \u201cstraight from the crime scene to the club\u201d, as Jennifer Lopez\u2019s den mother, Ramona, puts it, suggesting that her own lawless behaviour is simply fair game. Based on, and faithful to, a 2015 <em>New York Magazine</em> article by Jessica Pressler, <em>Hustlers</em> is a classically made film about capital \u2013 sexual, social and financial. What feels contemporary is the way it weaves in the impact of the 2008 financial crisis; Wall Street on its ass, seen from an upskirt vantage point. For all its razzle-dazzle, its pessimistic subtext reminded me of another downbeat, post-recession take on the entertainment industry, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/15/magic-mike-steven-soderbergh-review\" title=\"\">Magic Mike</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/15/crazy-rich-asians-review-observer\" title=\"\"><em>Crazy Rich Asians</em></a>\u2019 Constance Wu plays foil to Lopez\u2019s Ramona as the enjoyably unreliable ingenue Destiny, with Lopez harnessing her natural warmth, swagger and athleticism both on the pole and off. Writer-director Lorene Scafaria (2012\u2019s <em>Seeking a Friend </em><em>for the End of the World</em>) takes a playful approach to her source material, dressing Lopez in an enormous fur coat and lingerie in a nod to the music video for her 2002 hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dly6p4Fu5TE\" title=\"\">Jenny from the Block</a>.
