The News Corp paper claimed that the Threatened Species Recovery Hub was an \u201canti-coal group\u201d made up of \u201cgreenies\u201d who had been \u201chand-picked by the Palaszczuk government to review one of the mine\u2019s environmental management plans\u201d.

The newspaper published an opinion piece by the deputy director of the Hub on 22 February 2019 which was a robust defence of scientific practice.

      "bodyText": "The defamation case between BuzzFeed and Emma Husar will not proceed to a trial after the two parties reached an out-of-court settlement. The court heard on Monday that the former Labor MP\u2019s case against the online publisher over an article which she said portrayed her as \u201ca slut\u201d and \u201csexually perverted\u201d had reached settlement. The former western Sydney MP is suing BuzzFeed Australia, its American parent company BuzzFeed Inc and the former BuzzFeed journalist Alice Workman. In a case management hearing, Husar\u2019s lawyer, Sandy Dawson SC, told the court \u201cthe matter has settled and the form of the deed has now been agreed\u201d. But detail over the settlement will wait until next week, because of what Dawson called a \u201ccrossing of wires\u201d between the two parties. \u201cThe delay is in the execution of the document by the respondent, I\u2019m told that the CEO and the CFO for BuzzFeed in America will be executing the document on behalf of the respondent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Ms Workman who is a respondent is expected to execute today.\u201d Husar launched defamation proceedings against BuzzFeed in December of last year over what she described as a \u201cslut-shaming\u201d story that led to her announcing she would not recontest her seat at the next election. Husar said she was defamed in an article, a tweet and a Facebook post in August outlining misconduct allegations made against her and examined as part of a confidential internal Labor investigation. She said the article claimed she had bragged about her sexual relations, sexually harassed an employee and exposed herself to a colleague and his infant son. The article, she said, included a number of false and defamatory allegations about her including that she was \u201ca slut who boasts about who she has had sex with, which includes other members of parliament and members of her staff\u201d. \u201cI am not a bully, I am not Sharon Stone, I am not a thief and I did not deliberately misuse my work expenses,\u201d she said, referencing the Hollywood star widely associated with a \u201csexually graphic film scene\u201d, she said in parliament in December. BuzzFeed had argued it did not use the word \u201cslut\u201d, and denied the imputations. It maintained a truth defence to other allegations including that Husar is \u201csexually perverted\u201d and \u201cengaged in inappropriate sexualised behaviour toward her staff\u201d.",
