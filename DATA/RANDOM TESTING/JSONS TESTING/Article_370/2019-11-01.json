      "bodyText": "Sajid Javid has denounced an article by the controversial journalist Rod Liddle that appeared to call for elections to be held on days when Muslims are forbidden by their religion to vote. The column in the Spectator magazine has also been condemned for ridiculing a Labour MP\u2019s decision to speak out about her experience of domestic abuse. Fraser Nelson, the magazine\u2019s editor, told the Guardian that the article \u201cshould not have been published in the form that it was\u201d but defended Liddle\u2019s right to attempt to satirise UK politics. Several contributors at the magazine, including the assistant editor, Isabel Hardman, have expressed dismay at the column for being neither amusing nor worth writing. Liddle\u2019s article suggested elections should be held at a time when the Muslim and student vote could be minimised in order to improve the Conservatives\u2019 chances of victory. \u201cMy own choice of election date would be a day when universities are closed and Muslims are forbidden to do anything on pain of hell, or something,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere must be at least one day like that in the Muslim calendar, surely?
