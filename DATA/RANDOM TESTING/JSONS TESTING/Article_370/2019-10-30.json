For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids \u2018\u201cwasting\u201d your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tests of the website suggested there were many examples of advice to vote Lib Dem in seats where there was little hope of victory and a vote for Jo Swinson\u2019s party would be likely to lead to a win for the Tories. </p> \n<p>A senior Labour party source said: \u201cThe only person who benefits from this bogus advice is Boris Johnson and the vested interests he protects.
