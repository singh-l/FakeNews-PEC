      "bodyText": "Coalport station, Shropshire Coalport, built in 1861, was never a bustling hub even at the height of the Industrial Revolution. Today, its owners, Lisa and Steve Rawlings, who fell in love with the sleepy, disused station, platforms and waiting room, capitalise on its bucolic location in the heart of Ironbridge Gorge, offering self-catering stays in two converted carriages. On the outside, the retired GWR rolling stock, in trademark chocolate and mustard, looks old-school but inside it\u2019s all pale wood, cream leather sofas and corner whirlpool baths, plus retro rail posters on the walls. In four acres with woodland boardwalk trails on the doorstep, it\u2019s close to a gastropub, the Woodbridge Inn, on the banks of the River Severn, named after the bridge that once connected it to the village of Coalport. \u2022 Sleep four and six, from \u00a3370 for a two-night break in a four-person carriage, coalportstation.com Alpine Apartments, Betws-y-Coed, Conwy valley When a South African artist, photographer and environmentalist comes to Snowdonia national park and decides to turns his hand to restoration and interior design, the result is going to be interesting. With his Welsh wife, Gwyn, Jacha Potgieter has turned this 19th-century station into a creative hub with a coffee shop, gallery and, on the first floor, five holiday apartments. Described as \u201choneymoonish\u201d, apartment six is a bijoux bolthole with a bespoke metal headboard in the shape of angel\u2019s wings, and a flower-fringed balcony looking out over the platform to the hills beyond. Mexican-inspired apartment 10 is boudoir-chic, with hot pink walls and striking artworks, while apartment four has a Mexican-made terracotta tiled floor. Sleeping from two to six, they are furnished with items from Jacha\u2019s travels, such as Moorish doors, Arabic rugs and chandeliers, along with artistically upcycled pieces: bare boards, feathered lamps, chapel chairs and the odd romantic roll-top tub.

The last full-time signalman and station master decamped in 1946 and this traditional stone house is now a heritage-themed hideaway. Guests are given NYMR membership for the week and half-price travel up and down the line, but they can simply curl up by the window in the old ticket office and watch the trains chug past. The interiors are museum-like and crammed with authentic details. There\u2019s a wind-up gramophone in the claret-hued sitting room; the kitchen has a traditional range and sink (along with an electric oven hidden away) and a pantry.
