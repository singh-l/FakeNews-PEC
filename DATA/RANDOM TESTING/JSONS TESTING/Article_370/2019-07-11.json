In setting up Penneys, under which name the retailer still operates in Ireland, Ryan foresaw a fundamental shift towards what became known as the \u201cvalue segment\u201d \u2013 the growth market of the under-35s \u2013 and built on that to become, as dubbed by the industry bible Drapers magazine, \u201cthe most influential person in high street fashion\u201d. Ryan was always jealous of his privacy, generally refusing interviews and concerned for his own safety during the run of kidnappings of Irish businessmen during the Troubles of the 1980s. But he was no recluse. He was said to enjoy sport and to be a lively presence at parties. He was married twice, first to Rose, with whom he had four children, and then in 1978 to Alma Carroll, who had sung with the Swarbriggs to come third in the Eurovision song contest the previous year. They had a daughter, Jess. Three years ago Ryan was struck by family tragedy when his grandson, Barry Jr, was drowned with his girlfriend while fishing off rocks in West Cork, and his son Barry also died while attempting to save them. He is survived by Alma and Jess, three children, Colin, Arthur and Alison, from his first marriage, nine grandchildren, and his sisters Anne and Louise. \u2022 Arthur Ryan, retailer, born 19 July 1935; died 8 July 2019",
