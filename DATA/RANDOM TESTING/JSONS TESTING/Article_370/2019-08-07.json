Lack of planes/staff, flight overbooking, a strike by airline staff or an IT failure are all considered to be within the airline\u2019s control \u2013 so compensation is payable.</p>\n    <p>Passengers on cancelled short-haul flights \u2013 up to 1,500km \u2013 are entitled to \u20ac250 or \u00a3230. For flights of 1,500km-3,500km, passengers are entitled to \u20ac400, and \u20ac600 for the longest flights (more than 3,500km).</p>\n    <p>Compensation is also payable if the plane is delayed. The payments are the same but only kick in when the plane has been delayed three hours for short flights or four hours for the longer trips. The delay is calculated against the time the plane was due to arrive.</p>\n    <p>Passengers are also entitled to \u2018assistance\u2019 under the EU rules. Short-haul passengers should receive food and water after two hours. Mid-distance passengers get help after three hours, while long-haul passengers receive it after they have been held in the terminal for four hours. If the delay is overnight, passengers should be provided with hotel accommodation but this often does not happen. This assistance should be provided irrespective of whether the delay is the airline\u2019s fault.</p>\n    <p>The airlines have fought these compensation rules since they were introduced and passengers have had to go to court to get their money. The airlines frequently blame delays on events outside their control. Freak weather events or a last-minute strike by air traffic controllers are deemed to be outside their control. A lack of planes or staff is not.</p>\n    <p>The rules only apply to EU-based airlines or all flights that start in the EU on non-EU based carriers.
