      "bodyText": "The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, has challenged Boris Johnson to visit the city and apologise directly for once publishing an article claiming drunken fans were partly responsible for the Hillsborough tragedy, after it was reported the government was reluctant to hold a major conference in the city. Anderson said on Sunday he had offered to host what the government has billed as \u201cthe biggest ever northern powerhouse conference\u201d on 13 September after Sheffield, the initial prospective host, could not find a suitable venue. But he said his offer of the Arena and Convention Centre, which hosted last year\u2019s Labour party conference, had been turned down. It is understood Johnson has not been formally invited to the conference and No 10 rejected any suggestion he was blocking or delaying the decision. With barely a month to go, Downing Street has still not revealed where the conference will take place. It adds salt to wounds first opened up when Johnson chose Manchester as the venue for his first speech as the prime minister last month, using it to back a new high-speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds without making any mention of Liverpool. It was a \u201cshortsighted omission\u201d, said Anderson, who insisted more people currently travel by rail between Liverpool and Manchester than Manchester to Leeds. Asked if Johnson would get a \u201cwarm welcome\u201d were he to visit Liverpool, Anderson said: \u201cHe\u2019d get a hot welcome. It wouldn\u2019t be warm.\u201d Anderson said Liverpudlians had not forgotten the editorial Johnson published when he was the editor of the Spectator, in 2004, which claimed the people of Liverpool were \u201chooked on grief\u201d and blamed \u201cdrunken fans\u201d for contributing to the Hillsborough disaster of 1989 in which 96 people were killed. The Liverpool Echo had originally reported the city was being overlooked in the deliberations on who would host September\u2019s Convention of the North. \u201cThere is a feeling in the local halls of power that government simply doesn\u2019t want to come here,\u201d the paper had said. Shortly before Johnson entered Downing Street, the paper also ran a story with the headline \u201cLiverpool won\u2019t forget what prime minister hopeful Boris Johnson did\u201d. During his first prime minister\u2019s questions, Johnson refused to apologise for publishing the remarks when he was reminded of them by the Labour MP for Garston and Halewood, Maria Eagle. Back in 2012, when he was still mayor of London, Johnson had said he \u201cbitterly regretted\u201d the offence caused, but insisted he did not write the offending article. \u201cIf he came into the city and apologised directly then he might have a better chance of being given more respect, rather than just saying sorry from down south,\u201d Anderson said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), which announced the conference last month, would not say where the conference would be held, only that the government was proud to support it. He added the matter of the venue was for the organisers, the Northern Powerhouse 11, a group of northern local enterprise partnership chairs. Shortly before Johnson became prime minister, MHCLG put out a press release heralding the second cross-party convention of the north, which would bring together civic and business leaders with council leaders and elected mayors from all of the north\u2019s towns, cities and city regions to \u201cspeak with one voice\u201d.",

With all mobile phone networks, landlines and internet access cut off in the region, it has been impossible to establish how they are faring. The best he has managed is to get through to a local police station via satellite phones being used by security forces. \u201cThey just told me that everything is fine and that there\u2019s nothing to worry about. Kashmir is normal, they said, but from here in London it\u2019s anything but that,\u201d said Nasti. As the head of a global charity, he has good reason to be concerned about the Himalayan state in which he was born, which again finds itself plunged into turmoil after the Indian government revoked its special status. Known as Article 370, it stripped away the autonomy that Kashmir was granted in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947. The controversial move by India\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, has led to fears of widespread unrest and paralysed normal life as tens of thousands of extra troops and security personnel were dispatched to add to the estimated 500,000 already present, making it one of the world\u2019s most militarised zones. But thousands of miles away from the verdant valleys and stunning mountain-top scenery that have led some to describe Kashmir as \u201cparadise on Earth\u201d, towns and cities across Britain are also feeling the repercussions. Of the 1.1 million British Pakistanis, more than one million originate from the part of Kashmir governed by Pakistan. While there are no official figures for the number of Indian Kashmiris in Britain, the overall British Indian community numbers almost 1.4 million and support for India\u2019s position is strong among some sections. Wedged between India and Pakistan, Kashmir is divided between the two nations and bitterly contested by them.

But the solution is through peaceful dialogue, both between British Indians and Pakistanis and the respective governments of each country.\u201d The Indo European Kashmir Forum was established in London in the late 1980s to represent the interests of Kashmiri Hindus, who once made up a significant minority in India\u2019s only Muslim majority state. The bulk fled in 1990 as a popular insurgency against Indian rule took hold. Next month, the organisation is holding a number of events across Britain in support of the revoking of article 370, which it has welcomed with open arms.

Revoking article 370 will lead to a better future for Kashmir.\u201d Underpinning Modi\u2019s stance on Kashmir is the growth of Hindu nationalism in India in recent times, exhibited in the landslide victory of the BJP during general elections earlier this year. This has resulted in a small number of incidents where members of minority groups, like Muslims, have been assaulted and even hanged for allegedly killing cows, a sacred animal in the Hindu faith, to more prevalent cases where domestic airline crews have been told to proclaim \u201cJai Hind,\u201d (victory to India) when making announcements. Officials claimed that it was introduced to reflect \u201cthe mood of the nation\u201d. With no end in sight to Kashmir\u2019s current isolation, for Nasti the arduous wait continues. He said: \u201cI keep calling and calling in the hope that the lockdown will be lifted so that I can speak to my family and friends and also visit soon.
