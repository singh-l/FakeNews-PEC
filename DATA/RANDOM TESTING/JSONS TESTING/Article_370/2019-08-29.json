      "bodyText": "A bullish Boris Johnson has sought to reassure Tory MPs queasy about his plan to suspend parliament by announcing he wants to \u201cstep up the tempo\u201d of Brexit talks in Brussels. After his chief negotiator, David Frost, met EU officials in Brussels on Wednesday, the prime minister said on Thursday that both sides had agreed to meet twice a week. \u201cI have said right from my first day in office that we are ready to work in an energetic and determined way to get a deal done. While I have been encouraged with my discussions with EU leaders over recent weeks that there is a willingness to talk about alternatives to the anti-democratic backstop, it is now time for both sides to step up the tempo,\u201d Johnson said. Downing Street is gearing up to resist efforts by MPs, lawyers and campaigners to frustrate his suspension of parliament. Johnson\u2019s team face a battle on several fronts, with the Scottish court of session due to rule on Friday on whether proroguing parliament is unconstitutional and MPs drawing up plans to legislate against a no deal. Downing Street believes it can defeat the legal challenge, if necessary in the supreme court, and it will use every parliamentary tactic available to frustrate the rebel MPs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear before that we will deliver Brexit by any means necessary and that remains the case,\u201d said one Downing Street source. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for a cross-party group of 75 MPs and peers, told the Scottish court of session in Edinburgh that Johnson had trampled on more than 400 years of constitutional law by asking the Queen to prorogue parliament solely for political gain. \u201cWe have a constitution ruled by law,\u201d O\u2019Neill told Lord Doherty, urging him to issue an interdict \u2013 a Scottish court order equivalent to an injunction \u2013 forcing the UK government to quash the prorogation order signed by the Queen on Wednesday. Whitehall sources said the government was \u201cpretty confident of our case\u201d and would pursue it to the supreme court \u201cif for some reason the judgment went the other way\u201d. Johnson\u2019s ruthless approach was underlined on Thursday evening when the chancellor\u2019s media adviser was abruptly sacked. It is understood the special adviser, who had previously worked for Sajid Javid\u2019s predecessor as chancellor, Philip Hammond, was dismissed on the spot by the prime minister\u2019s aide, Dominic Cummings, and escorted out of Downing Street. The dismissal followed the last-minute cancellation of a speech planned for Wednesday by Javid and comes a few days ahead of a critical spending review. However, cracks appeared on Thursday in the government\u2019s careful public justification for the suspension of parliament when the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was caught on mic at a meeting in Helsinki on Thursday. Wallace, a longtime ally of Johnson, said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want. It has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality. So eventually any leader has to, you know, try.\u201d He continued: \u201cOur system is a winner-takes-all system. If you win a parliamentary majority, you control everything, you control the timetable. There\u2019s no written separation, so \u2026 you pretty much are in command of the whole thing. And we\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority and a coalition and that\u2019s not easy for our system.\u201d Downing Street later said Wallace \u201cmisspoke\u201d. Ministers privately admit the battle to block anti-no-deal legislation in the Commons next week appears all but lost, but efforts to frustrate the rebels is focusing on the House of Lords. Opposition peers expect Tory peers to attempt to filibuster the legislation, which will need to have passed through all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent before parliament is suspended or it will fall. Johnson has already suffered one setback in the Lords as George Young quit the Tory frontbench in the upper house on Thursday in protest at the decision to suspend parliament. In his resignation letter, Lord Young, who was a minister under Margaret Thatcher, said he was \u201cvery unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation, and its motivation\u201d. He said he was not part of any \u201cremainer plot\u201d. It is unclear how Johnson would respond if an anti-no-deal bill is passed mandating him to extend article 50, but it is widely believed at Westminster that No 10 is working on plans for a general election to be held after 31 October if possible but beforehand if necessary. Cabinet ministers who have previously been outspoken in their opposition to prorogation, including Amber Rudd and Matt Hancock, have been kept onboard by the hope Johnson can strike a reworked Brexit deal. They believe the real prospect of a no-deal Brexit will strengthen his hand in the negotiations and then persuade sceptical Labour MPs to support a deal rather than risk crashing out on 31 October. According to a diplomatic note of Frost\u2019s meeting in Brussels, seen by the Guardian, Frost downplayed Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament, describing it as normal. He told his interlocutors that Johnson wanted a deal but was not afraid of no deal. The UK government appears to be seeking to convince the EU that it can bounce parliament into accepting any rewritten deal. Frost told EU officials that it would be possible to ratify a Brexit deal in the second half of October and argued that a technical extension would not be necessary. This strategy matches Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d.
