She said the article claimed she had bragged about her sexual relations, sexually harassed an employee and exposed herself to a colleague and his infant son. The article, she said, included a number of false and defamatory allegations about her including that she was \u201ca slut who boasts about who she has had sex with, which includes other members of parliament and members of her staff\u201d. \u201cI am not a bully, I am not Sharon Stone, I am not a thief and I did not deliberately misuse my work expenses,\u201d she said, referencing the Hollywood star widely associated with a \u201csexually graphic film scene\u201d, she said in parliament in December. But the online publisher has avoided admitting liability over the article, instead agreeing to take the article offline. \u201cBuzzFeed considers reporting on the staff complaints was a matter of public interest,\u201d the statement read. \u201cFollowing a mediation, the matter was resolved and BuzzFeed has agreed to take down the article, without an admission of liability.\u201d Husar said she was defamed in an article, a tweet and a Facebook post in August outlining misconduct allegations made against her and examined as part of a confidential internal Labor investigation.
