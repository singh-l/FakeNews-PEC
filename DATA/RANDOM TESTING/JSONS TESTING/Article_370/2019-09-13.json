Asked to follow on, they had a stinker of a start at nought for one, but Tom Westley and Alastair Cook smoothed the waters with a partnership of 157. </p> <p>The teams shook hands after Westley was out for 97. The draw confirms that Warwickshire survive to play another Division One summer and sends winless Nottinghamshire down.

Gloucestershire cobbled together 46 for their last four wickets but Sussex easily knocked off the 74 needed, after Phil Salt and Stiaan van Zyl put on an unbroken 41 for the third wicket. Sussex have refound their mojo just in time \u2013 and lie fifth in the table \u2013 in with a glimmer of a chance if they win both their remaining matches. Gloucestershire slip down to third. </p> <p>After the match, the Sussex coach, Jason Gillespie, said he had been on the phone to the England coach, Trevor Bayliss. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Trevor Bayliss if we can have Jofra Archer back for the last game, but the answer was no.

      "bodyText": "Essex\u2019s championship charge stumbled as they were forced to spend the last day at Edgbaston batting to save the match. They were dismissed for 324 in the morning, also falling short of a crucial third batting point, with Warwickshire\u2019s captain Jeetan Patel pocketing six for 73. Asked to follow on, they had a stinker of a start at nought for one, but Tom Westley and Alastair Cook smoothed the waters with a partnership of 157. The teams shook hands after Westley was out for 97. The draw confirms that Warwickshire survive to play another Division One summer and sends winless Nottinghamshire down. Essex, eights points behind leaders Somerset, entertain Surrey at Chelmsford next week and go to Taunton for the final round. The Division Two championship race heated up after Sussex beat Gloucestershire in Bristol by eight wickets. Gloucestershire cobbled together 46 for their last four wickets but Sussex easily knocked off the 74 needed, after Phil Salt and Stiaan van Zyl put on an unbroken 41 for the third wicket. Sussex have refound their mojo just in time \u2013 and lie fifth in the table \u2013 in with a glimmer of a chance if they win both their remaining matches. Gloucestershire slip down to third. After the match, the Sussex coach, Jason Gillespie, said he had been on the phone to the England coach, Trevor Bayliss. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Trevor Bayliss if we can have Jofra Archer back for the last game, but the answer was no. That\u2019s fair enough. We had a bit of a joke about it. We\u2019ve decided not to bring in another overseas players for the last few games, like some of the other counties have done. We\u2019ll go with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d Northamptonshire easily beat bottom-of-the-table Leicestershire to secure second place in the table after Ben Curran and Alex Wakely made forties to ensure victory. \u201cMomentum is huge, we\u2019re playing with a lot of confidence,\u201d said Wakely afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s in our hands now, next week against Durham is a massive game. We want to finish second if we possibly can.\u201d So that\u2019s it from here for today - after Lancashire confirmed their promotion to Division One yesterday, today has signed Nottinghamshire\u2019s relegation warrant - therefore saving Warwickshire\u2019s place in Division One. It\u2019s all hotting up nicely for the last two rounds - with Somerset patting the nice eight point lead in their back pocket as they head for the Ageas Bowl; and all to play for in the remaining two Division Two promotion places. Thanks for all the messages and chat below the line and sticking with CCLive! on a quiet day. See you next week - good night! Win-less with only two rounds to go, Nottinghamshire are relegated to Division Two after a disastrous Championship campaign in which they have totted up only 11 batting points. They shake hands at Edgbaston after Tom Westley falls for 97 - giving him 237 runs in the match. Essex never recovered from their decision to bowl first - and now slip eight points behind Somerset in the championship race with just two games to go. WARWICKSHIRE RETAIN FIRST DIVISION STATUS FOR NEXT YEAR Good to see Jason Gillespie trying his hand for the last match of the season: \u201cI\u2019ve asked Trevor Bayliss if we can have Jofra Archer back for the last game, but the answer was no. That\u2019s fair enough, it was what I expected. We had a bit of a joke about it one the phone. We\u2019ve decided not to bring in another overseas players for the last few games, like some of the other counties have done. We\u2019ll go with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d In the Wantage Road area with some free time on your hands tonight? And things are purring over smoothly at Edgbaston - just time for both Westley (87 not out) and Alastair Cook (55 not out) to reach their hundreds before handshakes. Good news for Somerset fans - Tom Banton has just signed a new two-year contract extension. I\u2019ve just got an email from Somerset asking that anyone who wants to attend the final game against Essex lets them know as they\u2019re expecting heavy demand for media seats. Sky cameras will also be there. Uneasy lies the head that nearly wears the crown. Which leaves us with one..Warwickshire v Essex which is slowly meandering towards a draw. Essex 82-1 trail Warwickshire by 111, with 48 overs left in the day. A draw is still meaningful, as it will confirm Nottinghamshire\u2019s relegation, and Warwickshire\u2019s place in Division One for 2020. Van Zyl and Salt take Sussex safely home, which bunny-hops them up to fifth. See Div 2 table below. Thank you Mes for these lovely roses - good to see you are hedging you bets in case of an impromptu CCLive! garden party. Alastair Cook and Tom Westley nice and steady steady for Essex - 57-1. Some post-match quotes from Grace Road where Alex Wakely, who has stuck with Northants through thick and thin, is feeling positive. \u201cI feel in decent touch, I\u2019m enjoying batting without the pressures of captaincy, playing with a smile on my face. But everything is easy when you\u2019re winning! \u201cThat said, momentum is huge, we\u2019re playing with a lot of confidence, the balance of the team looks good and we\u2019re in a very good position. It\u2019s in our hands now, next week against Durham is a massive game. We want to finish second if we possibly can.\u201d I haven\u2019t worked this out so I hope it doesn\u2019t spell something rude like the rogue Guardian crossword the other day, but something to pass the afternoon. A lovely apple from the tree polishes off lunch nicely. Meanwhile at Bristol, Tom Haines has gone but Sussex are nearly there on their latest of late charges. Just 24 more to win. Curran and Wakely guide Northants to victory, which takes them up to second in the Division Two table, nine points ahead of Gloucestershire, 14 points clear of Durham, and 16 clear of Glamorgan, who will be overtaken by Sussex this afternoon. Division One Warwickshire 517; Essex 324 (Westley 141; Jeetan Patel 6-73) and 26-1. Essex trail by 167 runs with 9 wickets and 66 overs remaining . Division Two Gloucestershire 200 &amp; 243; Sussex 370 and 24-1. Sussex need 50 to win. Northants have lost a couple more wickets but it\u2019s almost in the bag - just 20 more needed. And THANK YOU so much to Wegie below the line for spotting this - it seems the Darren Stevens show may have another season yet to run. \u201cWe are allowed to change our minds and we want to reward performance,\u201d Kent head coach Matt Walker told BBC Radio Kent. \u201cAt the moment Darren\u2019s performances are right up there. \u201cWe have to get the balance right - especially at Kent - between still trying to be competitive and win, but also making sure young players are progressing.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with how he batted, more than how he bowled. Those runs at that stage of the game were very important. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t batted as well as he would have liked in this format and that was vintage Darren with the bat, which was great to see. \u201cAnd with the ball he\u2019s been fantastic for the last few wickets, as he has been for however many years.\u201d Safe to say that David Warner has a bit of a shocker. Out for 0 - lbw Broad Out for 0 - c Bairstow b Broad Out for 0 - lbw Broad Out for 61 - c Bairstow b Archer Out for 5 - c Burns b Archer Out for 3 - b Broad Out for 8 - c Bairstow b Broad Out for 2 - lbw Broad Out for 5 - c Bairstow b Archer Gloucestershire all out. Sussex need 84 to win. Ah! I forgot that the follow-on in county cricket is 150. Warwickshire have in fact enforced the follow on. And calamity! Nick Browne is out to the fourth ball of the innings. Essex 0/1. Essex all out after a pig of a morning for 324. A deficit of 193. Warwickshire just need to bat out the day to be assured of Division One cricket next year, and hand Somerset a tasty lead going into the final two rounds. The irrepressible Jeetan Patel finished with 6-73. A wicket at Grace Road, Rob Newton for 29, but surely too late for any last-minute wobbles. Northants 74-1, need 67. Thinking on the New Zealand tour - which, I was reminded at Lord\u2019s yesterday, won\u2019t count for the new Test World Championship. If they rest most of the World Cup &amp; Test players and hand the captaincy to Stokes - on the assumption that he would like to go back to New Zealand -who else gets on the plane? Some names to throw in the pot - Sibley, Crawley, Azad (too soon?), Pope, Foakes, Ollie Robinson, Donald, Malan, Gregory, Bartlett? Nice to see Ben Curran getting runs in what hasn\u2019t quite been the breakthrough season he was hoping for - only one fifty in nine innings to date. When men were men, and phones were MASSIVE. Essex having a Friday wobble, two wickets gone in the first half hour. Gloucestershire are having one of those mornings, the eighth wicket goes with the lead only 35. Sussex, who were jeered at by a rather pathetic bunch of home fans before the summer break, could be about to pull the rabbit out of the hat. On his fiftieth birthday, Shane Warne makes one of his most important contributions to cricket, speaking out on the climate crisis. A wicket with the fourth ball of the day for Chris Jordan down at Bristol, Jack Taylor for ten. Gloucestershire\u2019s lead is just 30. Follow all the latest at the Test with our crack team of OBOers. We could pass the time BTL on what will be a quietish day by chewing on our pencils to come up with 16s for the men\u2019s winter tour parties: New Zealand in November for five T20s and two Tests; then a mega-tour of South Africa from December to February consisting of four Tests, three ODIs and three T20s. Division One: Warwickshire 517; Essex 278-6. Essex trail by 239 runs with four wickets remaining (first innings). Division Two: Gloucestershire 200 &amp; 197-6; Sussex 370. Gloucs lead by 27 runs with four wickets remaining (second innings). Division Two: Leicestershire 308 &amp; 189; Northants 357 &amp; 22-0. Northants need 119 runs to win. Division One: Hampshire (149 &amp; 436) beat Surrey (162 &amp; 151) by 272 runs. Kent (304 &amp; 259) beat Nottinghamshire (124 &amp; 212) by 227 runs. Somerset (199 &amp; 329) beat Yorkshire (103-9 &amp; 127-9) by 298 runs. Division Two: Middlesex (143 &amp; 151) beat Durham (147 &amp; 191) by 44 runs. Lancashire (418) beat Derbyshire (244 &amp; 129) by an innings and 45 runs. Worcestershire (205 &amp; 299) beat Glamorgan (193 &amp; 156) by 155 runs. Good morning! from this final day of the-round-before-the-penultimate-round of the season, where just three games are still breathing. As it was ordained, the day has dawned brightly in Manchester now that Lancashire have returned to the bright lights of Division One, thanks to a thumping win over Derbyshire yesterday.

      "body": "<p>Jo Swinson has ruled out backing a Jeremy Corbyn-led government after a general election, saying the Liberal Democrats could not even have an informal support arrangement with Labour, despite recent cooperation to block a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of her first Lib Dem conference as party leader in Bournemouth on Sunday, Swinson said she favoured \u201cpluralist politics\u201d and cross-party work, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/27/brexit-jeremy-corbyn-prioritise-legislation-stop-no-deal-meeting-opposition-parties-labour\">when opposition MPs </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/27/brexit-jeremy-corbyn-prioritise-legislation-stop-no-deal-meeting-opposition-parties-labour\"> grouped together</a> to force a Brexit extension and block an election.</p> <p>But major policy differences and serious personal worries about Corbyn and Boris Johnson meant she could not support either in government, Swinson told the Guardian.</p> <p>With the Lib Dems buoyed by a recent wave of MPs arriving from other parties, and more defections predicted, Swinson cast the upcoming election as a choice between the old-fashioned, Brexit-minded two main parties and her party\u2019s outward-looking stance.</p> <p>\u201cThe faultline in British politics is no longer a left-right divide, and that is what the Labour-Conservative duopoly of politics was predicated on,\u201d said Swinson, who became the first woman to lead the Lib Dems <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/22/jo-swinson-elected-new-lib-dem-leader\">in July</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe fundamental faultline now is between liberal and authoritarian values, and as Liberal Democrats we are clearly on one side of that. Both Labour and the Conservatives are having to straddle that faultline. That is why those two parties are creaking at the seams.\u201d</p> <p>Swinson accused Corbyn of \u201ctotally, totally failing\u201d to eradicate antisemitism from Labour, and said Johnson viewed politics as \u201ca game\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The faultline in British politics is no longer a left-right divide, and that is what the Labour-Conservative duopoly of politics was predicated on</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn Boris Johnson\u2019s case I just do not think he cares about people,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he only cares about himself. I find it easy to get on with most people in politics, but I find that difficult to respect.\u201d</p> <p>Swinson has sought to distinguish the Lib Dems\u2019 remain message from Labour\u2019s by saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/09/liberal-democrats-poised-to-back-revoking-article-50-brexit\">her party would revoke article 50</a> and cancel Brexit without a referendum. She conceded some would view this as \u201ca bold move\u201d, but argued it would be anomalous for a Lib Dem government to be obliged to negotiate a deal in Brussels when it was so publicly wedded to staying in the EU.</p> <p>A post-election hung parliament could see Swinson cast as the powerbroker, potentially able to put Corbyn or Johnson into Downing Street. Neither would happen, she said. \u201cJeremy Corbyn is not fit to be prime minister. Boris Johnson is not fit to be prime minister. On a daily basis we get evidence of both of those things.\u201d</p> <p>Swinson dismissed the possibility of supporting Corbyn along the lines of the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/11/confidence-and-supply-what-does-it-mean-and-how-will-it-work-for-the-new-government\">confidence-and-supply arrangement</a> with the Conservatives. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can be clearer \u2013 I do not think he is fit to be prime minister.

      "bodyText": "Jo Swinson has ruled out backing a Jeremy Corbyn-led government after a general election, saying the Liberal Democrats could not even have an informal support arrangement with Labour, despite recent cooperation to block a no-deal Brexit. Speaking ahead of her first Lib Dem conference as party leader in Bournemouth on Sunday, Swinson said she favoured \u201cpluralist politics\u201d and cross-party work, such as when opposition MPs grouped together to force a Brexit extension and block an election. But major policy differences and serious personal worries about Corbyn and Boris Johnson meant she could not support either in government, Swinson told the Guardian. With the Lib Dems buoyed by a recent wave of MPs arriving from other parties, and more defections predicted, Swinson cast the upcoming election as a choice between the old-fashioned, Brexit-minded two main parties and her party\u2019s outward-looking stance. \u201cThe faultline in British politics is no longer a left-right divide, and that is what the Labour-Conservative duopoly of politics was predicated on,\u201d said Swinson, who became the first woman to lead the Lib Dems in July. \u201cThe fundamental faultline now is between liberal and authoritarian values, and as Liberal Democrats we are clearly on one side of that. Both Labour and the Conservatives are having to straddle that faultline. That is why those two parties are creaking at the seams.\u201d Swinson accused Corbyn of \u201ctotally, totally failing\u201d to eradicate antisemitism from Labour, and said Johnson viewed politics as \u201ca game\u201d. \u201cIn Boris Johnson\u2019s case I just do not think he cares about people,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he only cares about himself. I find it easy to get on with most people in politics, but I find that difficult to respect.\u201d Swinson has sought to distinguish the Lib Dems\u2019 remain message from Labour\u2019s by saying her party would revoke article 50 and cancel Brexit without a referendum. She conceded some would view this as \u201ca bold move\u201d, but argued it would be anomalous for a Lib Dem government to be obliged to negotiate a deal in Brussels when it was so publicly wedded to staying in the EU. A post-election hung parliament could see Swinson cast as the powerbroker, potentially able to put Corbyn or Johnson into Downing Street. Neither would happen, she said. \u201cJeremy Corbyn is not fit to be prime minister. Boris Johnson is not fit to be prime minister. On a daily basis we get evidence of both of those things.\u201d Swinson dismissed the possibility of supporting Corbyn along the lines of the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservatives. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can be clearer \u2013 I do not think he is fit to be prime minister. He is trying to take our country into Brexit. He has failed to tackle antisemitism in his own party.\u201d Lib Dem numbers in the Commons have swelled in recent weeks as Chuka Umunna, who moved to the party shortly before Swinson became leader, was joined by fellow ex-Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Angela Smith, as well as the former Tories Phillip Lee and Sarah Wollaston and the byelection winner Jane Dodds. The new arrivals have caused internal tensions, with some Lib Dem activists complaining about \u201ccelebrity MP entryism\u201d after Umunna and Berger were lined up for winnable London seats. Swinson said an influx of MPs was \u201ca nice problem to have\u201d, but conceded it could result in some existing candidates being asked to stand down: \u201cThat has to be managed, but I\u2019ve been really impressed at how people have responded to that.\u201d The arrival of Lee, who abstained in the vote on equal marriage and argued that immigrants should show they do not have HIV or hepatitis B before being allowed into the UK, has caused a separate row, with the head of the Lib Dems\u2019 LGBT group quitting in protest. Swinson conceded the move had caused difficulties but argued this was mainly one of messaging, defending Lee for \u201ca very nuanced position\u201d, which, she said, had been misrepresented in parts of the media. \u201cObviously, I regret that some people have been upset by that. I think we can certainly learn some lessons about our internal processes, how we communicate.\u201d She stressed the party would not accept any MPs without question, saying would-be new entrants must undergo a 90-minute grilling from the Lib Dem chief whip, Alistair Carmichael, to \u201cmake sure they share our liberal values\u201d. Recent weeks have illustrated the paradox faced by Swinson ahead of a conference at which the Lib Dems will celebrate record membership of more than 120,000: while Brexit is the party\u2019s great foe, it is also arguably the prime reason for its surge. \u201cIf you gave me a choice I\u2019d put no Brexit above having a good opportunity for the Lib Dems, every day of the week,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is a huge opportunity, which is obviously exciting.
