The second season in particular has highlighted the great insularity wealth provides the Roys and their ilk. Several of the episodes have been contained to remote, inaccessible, lush locations \u2013 a Hungarian hunting lodge, an Aspen-esque ideas festival, private jets, the peak of WASPness that is Tern Haven, the yacht \u2013 and hinted at the small army of assistant, PR folk, and housekeepers who buffer their every interaction with the world. Case in point: the season finale\u2019s jarring image of Logan Roy at a highway-side coffee stop somewhere in Europe, avoiding an inconvenient automatic door while Facetiming a major shareholder (apparently no amount of billions can insulate you from the unflattering below-chin Facetime angle).</p> <p>The shareholder tentatively floats the mood of his representatives: that Logan take the hit for the cruise scandal and step down. The likelihood that this would ever happen, despite Logan seeming to consider it in public, was always close to zero; throughout the season, any move toward answering the question of his succession has only entrenched Logan deeper into his increasingly maniacal reign. But the cruise scandal was toxic enough \u2013 mysterious deaths, sexual harassment, \u201cno real person involved\u201d \u2013 that even Logan\u2019s power grip isn\u2019t immune. He\u2019s also not immune to \u201chow was your call reception?\u201d pop-ups on his cell phone, notable in how striking it is to watch Logan have even a small brush with daily inconvenience.</p> <h2>\u2018Death sentence vibes\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"484d5013ec22b723c3b2ebe5a85c2b3144503fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/484d5013ec22b723c3b2ebe5a85c2b3144503fcb/0_251_6829_4097/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession season two finale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After a teasing glance at Cousin Greg\u2019s bumbling congressional testimony on the buried cruise mismanagement, Succession moved to the Mediterranean, where the Roys tower over lowly fishing boats in their huge yacht. (The setting is ironic \u2013 a cruise break from the cruise-line scandal \u2013 but also evocative of the several real-life media mogul yacht dramas, such as Rupert Murdoch\u2019s fall on his son\u2019s yacht in Australia.) Logan was, again, not going to go out from the company quietly, and the public demanded at least one head roll for the cruise fiasco. The Waystar Royco yacht cruise may abound in breezy linens and sunhats, but the mood was, as Tom said, \u201cdeath sentence vibes\u201d. Someone was going down, if not the company itself, a possibility heightened by the arrival of annoyed, and hostage-situation-chastened, Roman. On the up from two brutal slaps this season \u2013 Logan calling him a moron, Logan literally knocking out his tooth \u2013 Roman rebounds with the uncharacteristically sober (and probably correct) assessment that the central Asian money is bullshit. Without the option to go private, the options for the company are *Shiv throat-slice motion, Tom tumbles off waterslide*.</p> <p>The finale seems to mark a maturation of sorts for Roman \u2013 we see him offering rare honest advice to Logan, sincerely, if awkwardly; defending Gerri in the breakfast summit; expressing genuine concern for Kendall when he seems defeated by Logan\u2019s blood sacrifice. By episode\u2019s end, Logan names Roman permanent COO, solo. But given Kendall\u2019s last-second twist, does Roman\u2019s upward arc bend toward his father, his brother, or somewhere new?</p> <h2>\u2018Gobble the odd side dick\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c0b32590a2f5de0b3b0b25932e9ecbc8f2b61dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c0b32590a2f5de0b3b0b25932e9ecbc8f2b61dd/0_440_6683_4009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession season two finale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>All is not well on the island of Shiv and Tom, after a season in which Shiv\u2019s ruthless attempt to ascend Waystar Royco has been largely despite, not alongside, her husband. Their partnership has always seemed odd and for Shiv, somewhat inexplicable in its uselessness for exploitation; one of the show\u2019s few flaws is that it has yet, in this viewer\u2019s opinion, at least, to convey why Shiv even went out with Tom in the first place, let alone remained so loyal to a husband whose tone-deaf kiss-assery elicits her eye rolls at least once an episode. I mean, Shiv asked/demanded an open marriage <em>on their wedding night \u2013</em><em> </em>a \u201cgobble the odd side dick\u201d arrangement Tom finally confronts in the finale, after backing out of their planned threesome with a yacht waitress. Their relationship seems to disintegrate further after Shiv doesn\u2019t hesitate to question tossing Tom to the cruise-ship wolves in the family summit, and Tom delivers the devastating line: \u201cI wonder if the sad I\u2019d be without you is more than the sad I am with you.\u201d (Not to be overshadowed by another Tom food powerplay \u2013 last season\u2019s finale saw him forcing Shiv\u2019s lover, Nate, to pour wine back into the bottle; this year, he eats a drumstick off Logan\u2019s plate.)</p> <p>Will Shiv and Tom\u2019s relationship survive? Will the third season offer new insight into the origins of their relationship? Shiv, seemingly humbled by the prospect of a breakup, ultimately asks Logan for Tom\u2019s protection. But with Cousin Greg now a cruise scandal turncoat, how vulnerable is Tom?</p> <h2>\u2018Someone\u2019s getting shitcanned\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"459726a654868e37d74bc288ffec92e8991bbc02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459726a654868e37d74bc288ffec92e8991bbc02/44_0_7026_4217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession season two finale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Someone was always going to take the fall for the cruise scandal \u2013 get \u201cshitcanned\u201d, in Roman-ese \u2013 and the blood sacrifice provided an opportunity for what Succession does best: contained scenes of characters spitballing off each other over expensive meals, using backhanded compliments and polite burns to fuck each other over. The breakfast table scene in which the Logan acolytes, including all his children, build up each other\u2019s company loyalty to throw them under the bus is among the seasons\u2019s best, up there with the dinner summit with the Pierces at Tern Haven. Besides which loyalties survived the fire (it looks like Roman and Gerri are fine; Gerri and Shiv, less so) the meeting brings up some important questions: what viral moments came out of \u201cSprinkle\u201d Greg\u2019s testimony? Does the public know about Shiv\u2019s witness intimidation? Will Connor quit his campaign? (And also, what did the New York Times say about Willa\u2019s play? Does the end of Connor\u2019s candidacy mean the end of the perpetually embarrassed Willa?) Was tearing each other apart Logan\u2019s intent in the first place?</p> <h2>Logan\u2019s No 1 boy no more</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0ce05aea0e9137911c52646c70139cc69092ee5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0ce05aea0e9137911c52646c70139cc69092ee5/0_304_6822_4093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession season two finale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The loser of the shitcan battle was, of course, Kendall, who goes from defeated and self-effacing company skull to whistleblower on his own father by episode\u2019s end. It\u2019s fitting that the night\u2019s big twist belonged to Kendall, once the heir apparent, after last season finale\u2019s shocker: Kendall\u2019s drug-fuelled, Chappaquiddick-esque car crash that killed a British waiter. Kendall has spent most of the season haunted, a wounded dog with an emotional crater so deep it drew even the concern of his sympathy-void siblings and former friend Stewy. After a season of dutifully serving his father\u2019s whims (RIP Vaulter), what turned Kendall to that crucial, Karolina panic-inducing \u201cBUT\u201d in the final press conference? Was it Naomi Pierce\u2019s cutting observation that Logan \u201cloves the broken you\u201d? Logan admitting he never thought Kendall had the killer instinct for the top job? Secret documents on the jet from Greg? Had he planned it all along? That and Logan\u2019s half-smile at Kendall\u2019s treachery are up for debate \u2013 the show-runner, Jesse Armstrong, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/succession-showrunner-talks-season-2-finale-twist-1247436\">told The Hollywood Reporter</a> that \u201cdifferent interpretations are valid\u201d. Whatever the case, Kendall\u2019s betrayal leaves the show with fertile ground for season three: retreading the son v father battle from the first season, but with new stakes, heightened ammunition, and loyalties potentially up for grabs.</p>",
