      "body": "<p>The Taiwanese-American film producer Dennis Liu was intimately aware of the <a href=\"http://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-inequality-report-2019-09-03.pdf\">lack of diversity in Hollywood</a>, and of the <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/dennis-liu-marie-iida-work-break-model-minority-myth-comic-n1063351\">difficulties people of color faced</a> in getting their projects greenlit. That\u2019s why, after coming up with the idea for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/04/raising-dion-review-black-superhero-boy-netflix-michael-b-jordan\">Raising Dion</a>, he created a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/01/raising-dion-comic-book-diversity-dennis-liu\"> one-issue comic</a> and a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=dW9EIxEqrJw\"> two-minute short film</a> to drum up interest for a live-action adaptation in 2015. The idea soon caught on, and what resulted from Liu\u2019s unconventional marketing is Netflix\u2019s nine-episode Raising Dion, written by Carol Barbee and directed by Liu himself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/04/raising-dion-review-black-superhero-boy-netflix-michael-b-jordan\">Raising Dion review \u2013 seven-year-old superhero is a cereal thriller</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story at the center of Raising Dion has struggling mother Nicole (Alisha Wainwright) trying to figure out how to raise her suddenly superhuman son Dion (Ja\u2019Siah Young), all while job-hunting and mourning her dead husband Mark (Michael B Jordan). It\u2019s a family drama wrapped up in the paranormal, and one that answers the question of what a superhero origin story might look like if told from the point of view of Martha, rather than Clark, Kent.</p> <p>With Marvel and DC completely saturating the film market, it\u2019s notable that smaller publishers are finding homes for their projects on TV streaming platforms. Raising Dion follows in the footsteps of Amazon\u2019s The Boys and Netflix\u2019s Umbrella Academy, telling a different kind of story of a rather unique and cheerful eight-year-old superboy. Let\u2019s break down what works, what doesn\u2019t, and what\u2019s next for Netflix\u2019s latest comic book bid.</p> <h2><strong>Small-screen representation</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a73367cf00f247ff4d58e6e5ec970e79bc0bd7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a73367cf00f247ff4d58e6e5ec970e79bc0bd7d/0_0_1200_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alisha Wainright and Ja\u2019Siah Young\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alisha Wainwright and Ja\u2019Siah Young in Raising Dion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A major selling point for Raising Dion is undoubtedly that it\u2019s one of the only superhero shows centered on a black family, alongside the CW\u2019s Black Lightning. (Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage, the other major player in this category, was canceled in 2018.) Furthermore, while the aforementioned two, and the Black Panther film, all star grown men as leads, Raising Dion is notably centered on a young black mother and her young son.</p> <p>\u201cI started this project many years ago because I wanted to see more diverse representation on film and television,\u201d Liu told Deadline when <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2017/10/netflix-raising-dion-black-superhero-family-drama-michael-b-jordan-from-co-star-charles-d-kings-macro-carol-barbee-1202182365/\">Netflix ordered a season of Raising Dion</a> in 2017. \u201cMore than ever, we need more stories told from different points of view.\u201d</p> <p>Raising Dion incorporates representation in a variety of ways, from featuring a majority black cast to casting Sammi Haney, a young wheelchair user who has brittle bone disease, as <a href=\"https://themighty.com/2019/09/raising-dion-netflix-sammi-haney-wheelchair-disability/\">Dion\u2019s best friend Esperanza</a> (easily the standout character of the season). This diversity is treated as normal and unremarkable, but there are moments where the show\u2019s plot diverges to address how being marginalized may affect how someone moves through the world. At one point, Dion is racially profiled by his teacher, which painfully forces Nicole to explain to Dion what racism is. Later, Dion floats Esperanza out of her chair without asking, a moment of casual ableism he\u2019s later educated on.</p> <h2><strong>The </strong><strong>problem </strong><strong>with Pat</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74be68304688c006423a8b146f94824dc3c10604\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74be68304688c006423a8b146f94824dc3c10604/0_31_970_582/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Ritter in Raising Dion\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Ritter in Raising Dion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Undoubtedly one of the biggest reveals of the season is that Jason Ritter\u2019s awkward Pat Rollins is actually the villainous Crooked Man. It\u2019s a twist so out of left field that for a moment I froze and sat gawping at the screen. At the end of the second-to-last episode it\u2019s revealed Pat is not actually the nice guy he seemed: it\u2019s implied he killed his girlfriend from Iceland, and he most definitely absorbed several other supers from the trip, Dion\u2019s dad and Pat\u2019s own best friend Mark included. Pat also has a huge issue with respecting boundaries with women, and in his final moments he reveals he\u2019s, well, a self-entitled incel \u2013 a purposeful framing to start a conversation about <a href=\"https://www.tvguide.com/news/raising-dion-jason-ritter-alisha-wainwright-interview-review-netflix/\">male entitlement and consent</a>, Ritter told TV Guide.</p> <p>Does the reveal play entirely fair, though? The show spends an inordinate amount of time showing us Pat caring for Dion, with zero whispers of any ulterior motive. It seems like the show could have been better served revealing Pat\u2019s duplicity earlier, dedicating more episodes to Nicole and Dion then figuring out how to defeat him. Instead, it feels like Raising Dion pulls a Mad Daenerys twist, favoring shock value over a fully developed arc that could\u2019ve seen Pat be a formidable villain for the second half of the season.</p> <h2><strong>Brightburn </strong><strong>redux</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6koPaImHzY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z6koPaImHzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>At the end it\u2019s revealed that Pat wasn\u2019t so much the creator of the preternatural storm but probably just a host possessed by it. Dion and Nicole are able to deal with Pat relatively easily, but they don\u2019t succeed in wiping out the storm. Instead, the storm itself literally whizzes off, seeking a new body \u2013 and it certainly finds one in Brayden (Griffin Robert Faulkner), the second-generation, anger-prone young super that Charlotte (Deirdre Lovejoy) has a brief run-in with in Alabama.</p> <p>In the final moments of the show, it\u2019s revealed that Brayden killed his aunt, and is now carrying the storm inside him. This raises several questions: what is the storm? Is it an alien planet destroyer with its own agenda, or just a parasite that feeds off negative emotions? Is that why it\u2019s attracted to Pat and Brayden, who both demonstrate that they\u2019re unable to control their rage (particularly around women)? Is it what granted all the Iceland folks their powers to begin with, or is it a separate thing entirely that was riding the meteor?</p> <p>Regardless of what the storm is, if Brayden is also able to manifest multiple powers, Dion may just have his own Brandon Breyer to contend with.</p> <h2><strong>B</strong><strong>iona </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>good</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"309940a634c0ea3f2ece2cc29bf4e092b72eec4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309940a634c0ea3f2ece2cc29bf4e092b72eec4a/0_0_1280_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ja\u2019Siah Young in Raising Dion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the risk of feeling like a Maze Runner \u201cWCKD Is Good\u201d twist, it\u2019s revealed that the company that\u2019s been spying on Nicole and Dion, and which threw Dion in a CDC van with zero explanation to his panicked mother, are actually the good guys.

That Biona removed all evidence of spying on metahumans before giving Pat access to the labs, long before they knew he was the Crooked Man, is at least a little questionable.</p> <h2><strong>Cliffhanger </strong><strong>endings</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6cc5ec3fa371e74649042e71629b8fe83e0af58c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cc5ec3fa371e74649042e71629b8fe83e0af58c/0_0_1200_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ja\u2019Siah Young in Raising Dion\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ja\u2019Siah Young in Raising Dion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps one of the more frustrating things about Raising Dion is that despite feeling like a padded season, it still leaves so many questions unanswered.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Thursday\u2019s blog: Trump defended his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, allowing for Turkey to launch a military offensive against US-allied Kurdish forces in the region, noting that the Kurds \u201cdidn\u2019t help us with Normandy\u201d. Republican senator Lindsay Graham teamed up with democrat Chris Van Hollen to draft sanctions against Turkey. House Democrats are reportedly planning a new wave of subpoenas after the White House indicated it would not cooperate with their investigations. The Justice Department announced it had arrested a Defense Intelligence Agency employee for allegedly leaking sensitive national security information to journalists. For the first time, Joe Biden unequivocally called Trump\u2019s impeachment. Bernie Sanders said he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he said his campaign would slow down following a heart attack. Senators have released an outline of potential sanctions against Turkey, following news of the Turkish military offensive against US-allied Kurdish forces in Syria. Senator Lindsey Graham, a republican from South Carolina, joined with democratic Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen to draft the bill. Trump\u2019s decision to pull US troops out of the region, leaving Kurdish forces who bore the brunt of the US-led campaign against Isis defenseless has been met with bipartisan opposition. The senators said they would push sanctions unless the Trump administration confirms that \u201cTurkey is not operating unilaterally\u201d in Syria. Donald Trump pressed former secretary of state Rex Tillerson to persude the Justice Department to drop a case against an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who was a client of Rudy Giuliani, Bloomberg is reporting, citing three unnamed sources familiar with the 2017 meeting. Tillerson refused, arguing it would constitute interference in an ongoing investigation of the trader, Reza Zarrab, according to the people. They said other participants in the Oval Office were shocked by the request. Tillerson immediately repeated his objections to then-Chief of Staff John Kelly in a hallway conversation just outside the Oval Office, emphasizing that the request would be illegal. Neither episode has been previously reported, and all of the people spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the conversations. Zarrab was being prosecuted in federal court in New York at the time on charges of evading U.S. sanctions against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. He had hired former Attorney General Michael Mukasey and Giuliani, who has said he reached out repeatedly to U.S. officials to seek a diplomatic solution for his client outside the courts. The president\u2019s request to Tillerson -- which included asking him to speak with Giuliani -- bears the hallmarks of Trump\u2019s governing style, defined by his willingness to sweep aside the customary procedures and constraints of government to pursue matters outside normal channels. Tillerson\u2019s objection came to light as Trump\u2019s dealings with foreign leaders face intense scrutiny following the July 25 call with Ukraine\u2019s president that has sparked an impeachment inquiry in the House. The Guardian has not independently verified Bloomberg\u2019s report. Bernie Sanders said he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he said he\u2019d be slowing down his campaign In an interview with NBC, Sanders said he wouldn\u2019t be slowing down his campaign after suffering a heart attack, saying he misspoke when he told reporters that he will \u201cchange the nature of the campaign a bit\u201d after being hospitalized. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\u201d Last week, Sanders was at a campaign event in Nevada when he experienced chest discomfort and was taken to a hospital. \u201cI found that to be wholly appropriate,\u201d said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of the July call between Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cI was on the call. I listened to it. It was consistent with what President Trump has been trying to do to take corruption out\u201d Pompeo told PBS\u2019 Judy Woodruff. As we noted earlier, when Trump defended his decision abandon Kurdish allies in Syria by saying that they didn\u2019t help the US during World War II. \u201cThey didn\u2019t help us with Normandy as an example,\u201d Trump told reporters. Kurdish forces, did, however, fight alongside the US against Isis for nearly five years, losing roughly 11,000 fighters. On Sunday, the president announced that US troops would withdraw from the region, and today, Turkey has launched an offensive into north-eastern Syria against Kurdish forces who control the region. Trump said he learned that the Kurds didn\u2019t help in Normandy from a \u201cvery, very powerful article\u201d, and seemed to be referencing a column by conservative opinion writer Kurt Schlichter. Misrepresenting how Nato works, Trump told reporters: \u201cIf you look at how much money we spend on NATO and how much countries from Europe who are a much bigger beneficiary than we are.\u201d \u201cAlliances are very easy. But our alliances have taken advantage of us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have spent a tremendous amount of money helping the Kurds,\u201d the president said. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting for their land. When you say they\u2019re fighting with the US, yes. But they\u2019re fighting for their land.\u201d \u201cWith all of that being said, we like the Kurds,\u201d Trump added. Trump told reporters he\u2019ll cooperate with the House democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry if \u201cthey give us our rights\u201d. Asked whether he\u2019ll cooperate with the democrats if they hold a vote on the impeachment inquiry, Trump responded: \u201cThe Republican Party and president has been treated extremely badly by the Democrats, very unfairly, because they have a tiny margin in the House, they have eviscerated the rules, they don\u2019t give us any fair play, it is the most unfair situation people have seen, no lawyers, you can\u2019t have lawyers, you can\u2019t speak, you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d But does the president have the right to due process during an impeachment? In a word: No. From NPR: The Constitution states clearly that the House of Representatives \u201cshall have the sole Power of Impeachment,\u201d and that \u201cthe Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.\u201d What \u201cimpeachment\u201d means in this context is, effectively, indictment \u2014 the House has the power to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to spur a trial that would then take place in the Senate. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Justice Department announced the arrest of an employee at the Defense Intelligence Agency for allegedly leaking sensitive national security information to two journalists. For the first time, Joe Biden called for the impeachment of Trump over the Ukraine controversy. Trump defended his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria as Turkey launched a military operation in the region. (The president also flippantly said he was not worried about the potential escape of Islamic State fighters because they would likely flee to Europe.) Despite that defensive stance, a number of Republican lawmakers criticized Trump\u2019s Syria policy as news of the Turkish operation broke. House Democrats are reportedly planning a new wave of subpoenas as the White House made clear it would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Maanvi will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. House Democrats are preparing a new wave of subpoenas as the White House has signaled it will not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, according to CNN. They are also considering a secret interview of the whistleblower who kicked off the Ukraine controversy. CNN reports: In the face of the blistering White House letter refusing to cooperate with their probe, Democrats expect they are likely done with any voluntary interviews for most witnesses, according to multiple Democratic sources. And Democrats are now threatening subpoenas to associates of Rudy Giuliani and considering them for current State Department officials, including former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. She is scheduled for an interview Friday, but there are new concerns she won\u2019t appear given that she is still a State Department employee and could face backlash internally if she were to appear voluntarily. Negotiations are also intensifying over bringing in for an interview the whistleblower whose complaint has upended Trump\u2019s presidency, with new discussions about holding the interview in secret or off site and not disclosing that it happened until after the fact, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. In response to a question about the threat facing America\u2019s Kurdish allies now that Turkey had launched a military operation in northern Syria, Trump blamed them for not assisting in World War II. Asked about Islamic State fighters potentially escaping amid Turkey\u2019s military operation in northern Syria, Trump told reporters he felt the United States had carried a disproportionate amount of responsibility in capturing the militants. Trump said: \u201cWell, they\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe. That\u2019s where they want to go; they want to go back to their homes, but Europe didn\u2019t want them from us.\u201d The president said the relationship between the US and its European allies had not been \u201creciprocal\u201d when it came to combating the Islamic State. In response to Trump\u2019s comments, a CNN reporter questioned whether the flippant remark about Islamic State militants returning to Europe, where the group has previously carried out terrorist attacks, would provoke any condemnation from Republican lawmakers. Trump said he would cooperate with the impeachment inquiry if the full House votes on it and \u201cif the rules are fair,\u201d but he appeared to leave himself a lot of wiggle room on the issue. When asked by reporters whether he was concerned that Islamic State fighters would be able to escape because of Turkey\u2019s military operation, Trump predicted that the militants would not travel to the US. The president said this to apparently reassure the American people (and surely terrify many US allies): \u201cThey\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe.\u201d Trump also dismissed criticism from senator Lindsey Graham, one of his closest congressional allies, over the president\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from the region. Trump said: \u201cI think Lindsey would like to stay there for the next 200 years.\u201d Speaking to reporters after signing two executive orders, Trump stood by his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria even as Turkey launched a military operation in the region. Asked how he would react if Turkish forces decimated America\u2019s Kurdish allies in the region, Trump warned he would \u201cwipe out\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if they did so. The British prime minister\u2019s office released a readout from Boris Johnson\u2019s conversation with Trump. It reads, in part: \u201cThe Prime Minister spoke to President Trump this evening. The leaders expressed their serious concern at Turkey\u2019s invasion of north east Syria and the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe in the region. ... \u201cOn trade, the Prime Minister underlined his disappointment at the US announcement of tariffs against UK and EU exports in the Airbus-Boeing dispute, which will harm a number of industries including Scotch Whisky. He pressed the President not to impose the tariffs.\u201d Trump is now making remarks about two executive orders he is signing and noted that he had an \u201cextended conversation\u201d with the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. Even as senator Lindsey Graham lambastes Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, he is standing by the president on confronting the impeachment inquiry. Specifically, the Senate judiciary committee chairman is accusing House Democrats of abusing their power by not releasing a transcript from their closed-door interview with Kurt Volker, the former US ambassador to NATO. Graham warned that he would call Volker to publicly testify if the transcript is not released soon. Facebook is refusing to take down a Trump campaign ad that centers on false claims of corruption against Joe Biden. CNN has already refused to air the ad over its factual inaccuracies, but Facebook wrote in a letter to the Biden campaign that the video did not violate the social media platform\u2019s policies. A Facebook executive wrote: \u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\u201d The social media giant\u2019s decision provoked an enraged response from at least one of Biden\u2019s primary opponents, Elizabeth Warren. The minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting are out and Trump\u2019s trade policy is getting the blame for a slowing economy. \u201cTrade policy concerns continued to weigh on firms\u2019 investment decision,\u201d the Fed wrote, citing those tensions and a global economic slowdown as its reasons for cutting rates - albeit not by as much as Trump, a persistent critic of the Fed, had wanted. Trump has yet to tweet about the Fed - he\u2019s clearly too busy with \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d and impeachment. A senior adviser to the Turkish president claimed that Trump knew in advance \u201cprecisely\u201d the scope of the military operation in northern Syria. Meanwhile, more Republican lawmakers are condemning the president\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from the region, abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies. In addition to the trade discussion, Mike Pence was in Iowa to campaign for Republican senator Joni Ernst. When asked by a reporter yesterday whether it was acceptable for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, as Trump has previously confirmed he did, Ernst dodged the question three times. Ernst said: \u201cWe again, we don\u2019t have the facts in front of us. And what we see pushed out through the media, we don\u2019t know what is accurate at this point.\u201d But when repeatedly pressed on whether the request itself would be inappropriate, Ernst refused to answer until she simply turned away from the reporter. The Ukraine controversy does not appear to be causing alarm among Trump\u2019s base, if the attendees of an Iowa event with the vice president are any indication. Mike Pence is hosting a discussion on trade in the Midwestern state, and several of those attending the event dismissed the Ukraine controversy as an overblown political stunt by House Democrats, per an AP reporter there. Biden added in a separate tweet that Trump has \u201cindicted himself\u201d through his actions toward Ukraine and reiterated his call for the president\u2019s impeachment. Biden has responded to Trump\u2019s taunt by calling on him to release his tax returns, which the president has refused to do since the 2016 election. Trump was unsurprisingly dismissive of Biden\u2019s call for his impeachment, belittling it as \u201cso pathetic\u201d and repeating false corruption claims against the former vice president. The blog has covered this many, many times, but there is no evidence to support claims that Biden exploited his influence as vice president to aid his son or his business. The Ukrainian prosecutor who initially investigated corruption claims against a business with ties to Hunter Biden has said he does not believe either of the Bidens broke Ukrainian law. CNN even refused to air a Trump campaign ad centered on the accusations against Biden, saying it was factually inaccurate. Biden said that Trump had \u201cviolated his oath of office\u201d and represented a unique threat to the constitution. The former vice-president told the New Hampshire crowd: \u201cTo preserve our constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached.\u201d Biden had previously avoided specifically saying how he would vote on impeachment, citing his past role overseeing the Senate as vice president. Joe Biden went further than he ever has before on the Ukraine controversy, arguing that Trump \u201cshould be impeached.\u201d Speaking at a campaign event in New Hampshire, the former vice president warned that Trump believes he \u201ccan and will get away with anything he does.\u201d Biden referenced Trump\u2019s past claim that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York and get away with it. Biden said: \u201cIt\u2019s no joke. He\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution. And we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d According to the indictment, Frese allegedly transmitted information about \u201ca foreign country\u2019s weapons systems\u201d to a reporter identified as \u201cJournalist 1.\u201d That reporter then allegedly asked Frese to talk to \u201cJournalist 2,\u201d which the DIA employee agreed to do. According to a press release from the Justice Department, Frese and \u201cJournalist 1\u201d appeared to be involved in a romantic relationship together and shared a residence at one point. The justice department announced it has arrested an employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Henry Kyle Frese, for allegedly leaking sensitive information to two journalists. Assistant attorney general for national security, John C Demers, said in a statement: \u201cAs laid out in today\u2019s indictment, Frese was caught red-handed disclosing sensitive national security information for personal gain.\u201d Frese has been charged with two counts of willful transmission of national defense information to unauthorized recipients and could face up to 10 years in prison for each charge. In his statement on Turkey\u2019s military operation in northern Syria, Trump expressed his expectation that Turkish officials would take responsibility for the Islamic State fighters detained in prisons there. The prisons are currently maintained by America\u2019s Kurdish allies, who may have to abandon the sites given Turkey\u2019s latest operation. But even some Republican lawmakers have expressed concern that this development could lead to thousands of Islamic State fighters escaping. Trump has released a statement through a White House spokesperson on Turkey launching a military operation in northern Syria. The statement reads: \u201cThis morning, Turkey, a NATO member, invaded Syria. The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea. \u201cThere are no American soldiers in the area. From the first day I entered the political arena, I made it clear that I did not want to fight these endless, senseless wars\u2014especially those that don\u2019t benefit the United States. \u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place\u2014and we will hold them to this commitment. \u201cIn addition, Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape, or form. We expect Turkey to abide by all of its commitments, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Turkey has launched a military operation in northern Syria following Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from the region. In reaction to the White House letter saying officials would not cooperate with House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry because it was allegedly unconstitutional, Nancy Pelosi warned that Trump was just giving lawmakers more evidence of obstruction. Another poll found that half of American voters support removing Trump from office. There\u2019s still more coming up, so stay tuned. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren said she would not pursue big-dollar donors if she won the party\u2019s nomination. The Massachusetts senator has avoided such fundraisers in the primary race, but Warren had not said she would do so in a potential general election. The commitment could pose some issues for Warren if she becomes the eventual nominee, particularly given the massive fundraising operation Trump has built up in recent months. A former finance director for Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign slammed the decision as \u201ccolossally stupid.\u201d Some House Democrats are making the argument that the White House\u2019s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry will prove unsuccessful because of the evidence already in lawmakers\u2019 possession. Specifically, the Democrats argue that the whistleblower complaint, the White House memo on the Ukraine call and text messages shared by senior officials like Rudy Giuliani present a compelling case for Trump\u2019s removal from office. Democratic representative Gerry Connelly told CNN: \u201cYou know what you need to know from the documents that we already have. It is why I think the stonewalling is counterproductive and ultimately futile. \u201cThere are going to be more people coming forward irrespective of WH stonewalling. All it does is persuade the public ... [the President] is resisting for a reason.\u201d But senator Lindsey Graham told Fox &amp; Friends earlier today that Senate Republicans would not vote for Trump\u2019s removal based solely on the information already available on the Ukraine call. In impeachment-related news, US diplomats who expressed unease about withholding military aid from Ukraine were advised to downplay the eventual release of the funds, according to the New York Times. The Times reports: \u2018Keep moving, people, nothing to see here \u2026\u2019 Brad Freden, the State Department\u2019s acting deputy assistant secretary overseeing issues in Europe and Eurasia, wrote in a Sept. 12 email obtained by The New York Times. He said the National Security Council would not publicly announce that $141 million in State Department assistance was being restored after being held up in what the White House described as a normal review. ... A series of previously unreported internal State Department emails reflect diplomats\u2019 frustration with the unexpected freeze on funding that Congress had already approved. \u2018We realize the strain this puts on posts and your ability to conclude grants and carry out programs,\u2019 Jim Kulikowski, the State Department\u2019s regional assistance coordinator, wrote in an Aug. 5 email. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader in the House, has condemned Turkey for launching a military operation in northern Syria after Trump decided to withdraw US troops from the region. Given that McCarthy has been a key ally to Trump as the president attempts to combat House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, the California Republican may have a unique opportunity to push the commander-in-chief to change his position on Syria. But Trump has so far shown no sign of reconsidering his decision to withdraw the US troops. Senator Lindsey Graham is now more broadly attacking Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy, arguing that isolationism represents a dangerous threat to the nation. Graham said in a previous tweet, reacting to the news of Turkey\u2019s military operation in northern Syria, that America\u2019s Kurdish allies had been \u201cshamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke said he thinks Nancy Pelosi should hold a formal vote on opening an impeachment inquiry. Pelosi has said she does not plan to hold a vote and argued that the Constitution does not require such a formality to launch an impeachment inquiry, a reading that is backed up by legal experts. The House speaker is also likely trying to protect vulnerable Democrats, even though many of her caucus members from more conservative districts have come out in support of the inquiry. But depending on what the investigation uncovers, such a vote could eventually come to reflect badly upon the Republicans who would likely oppose it. Despite his opposition to Trump\u2019s Syria policy, senator Lindsey Graham has been one of the president\u2019s most ardent defenders when it comes to impeachment. Just this morning, the South Carolina Republican told \u201cFox &amp; Friends\u201d that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry threatens to \u201cdestroy the nation.\u201d Graham said of the Ukraine call: \u201cI\u2019ve read the transcript. ... I do not see anything wrong there, and I want Nancy Pelosi to know that Republican senators are not going to impeach this president based on this transcript.\u201d But the White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the inquiry may be another matter. Back when Bill Clinton was facing potential removal from office, Graham argued that Richard Nixon\u2019s greatest impeachable offense was failing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, urged the president to change course in Syria after news broke that Turkey has launched a military operation in the country\u2019s northern region. Graham warned in an interview last night that Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria could be a career-ending move. The South Carolina Republican told Axios: \u201cI think he\u2019s putting the nation at risk, and I think he\u2019s putting his presidency at risk. And I hope he will adjust his policies like he did before. That would actually be a sign of real leadership.\u201d Graham added: \u201cThis is worse than when Obama left Iraq, because you\u2019ve got so much information as to what happens. This would be a game changer to our national security. This would pave the way to the re-emergence of ISIS. ... \u201cIf I hear the president say one more time, \u2018I made a campaign promise to get out of Syria,\u2019 I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d Meanwhile, the president\u2019s former fixer, Michael Cohen, is reportedly being brought back to New York to reveal more information to state prosecutors who are investigating whether the Trump Organization falsified business records. CNN reports: The information, if deemed credible, could result in Cohen testifying before a grand jury, the official said. This meeting would be the third time Cohen has met with prosecutors and should happen this month, according to the official. It is expected to be held at the district attorney\u2019s office in Lower Manhattan with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance\u2019s general counsel and the head of the economic crimes bureau, the official said. It is unknown if Vance himself will be there. ... CNN first reported last month that officials from the district attorney\u2019s office, led by Vance, interviewed Cohen at the federal prison in Otisville, New York, where he is serving a three-year sentence after pleading guilty to multiple crimes including campaign finance violations tied to payments to two women alleging affairs with Trump a decade ago. Despite news of Turkey\u2019s military operation in Syria, Trump is keeping his attention squarely on the impeachment inquiry, even dubiously accusing special counsel Robert Mueller of perjury. Another Senate Republican, Marco Rubio of Florida, slammed the abandonment of America\u2019s Kurdish allies as \u201cmorally repugnant\u201d yesterday. Rubio also warned that Trump\u2019s foreign policy shift could lead to thousands of Islamic State militants being released from prison. The Washington Post has more on that: The U.S. military has no plans to intervene if Syrian Kurdish forces abandon a constellation of Islamic State prisons in Syria to confront a possible Turkish invasion, officials said Tuesday. Kurdish officials said that guards were still in place at the more than 20 prisons and camps under their control but were prepared to move, raising the possibility that about 11,000 militants and their families could escape. Trump defended his foreign policy in the Middle East in a pair of bombastic tweets this morning. But even some of Trump\u2019s closest congressional allies, including senator Lindsey Graham, have sounded alarm bells about clearing the way for a Turkish military operation in Syria. Turkish officials said the country was launching a military operation in northern Syria following Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that he would withdraw US troops from the region. Bethan McKernan reports: Several large explosions rocked the north-east Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, on the border across from the Turkish town of Ceylanp\u0131nar, a CNN Turk reporter said, adding that the sound of planes could be heard above. He said smoke could be seen rising from buildings in Ras al-Ain. Kurdish military leaders inside Syria have been braced for an attack since Donald Trump announced earlier this week that US troops were withdrawing from the area. [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan] said the offensive, dubbed \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019, would aim to eliminate threats from the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and Islamic State militants, and enable the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey after the formation of a \u2018safe zone\u2019 in the area, he said. On the 2020 campaign trail, Bernie Sanders said he would scale back his events following his heart attack last week. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d Sanders said after visiting a cardiologist in his home state of Vermont. \u201cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d The senator\u2019s comments might come as a surprise to some of his staffers, given that the campaign has insisted the candidate would continue with his bid as planned despite his health issues. His decision to slow down a bit will also likely intensify questions about whether he (and other older candidates like Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren) are the best options for the Oval Office. Another poll has come out this morning showing that about half of voters support removing Trump from office. According to the Politico/Morning Consult poll, 50% of voters would support Trump\u2019s removal, compared to 43% who would not. Those results come on the heels of yesterday\u2019s Washington Post/Schar School poll, which found that 49% of registered voters would support the president\u2019s removal. And Quinnipiac found that 45% of registered voters believe Trump should be removed from office. This marks an uptick in support in recent weeks as House Democrats have launched their formal impeachment inquiry, and Democratic leaders are counting on the number to continue rising as they present their case for impeachment. Good morning, live blog readers! The White House has come up with its strategy to combat House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry: denial. Of course, administration officials are not denying key elements of Donald Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, which were confirmed in the White House\u2019s own memo on the conversation. Instead, they\u2019re denying that Congress has the right to investigate the president. White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote in a letter to House speaker Nancy Pelosi: \u201cYou have designed and implemented your inquiry in a manner that violates fundamental fairness and constitutionally mandated due process.\u201d Legal experts said the White House letter did not rely on any sound reading of the constitution, and Pelosi warned in her own blistering statement that further efforts to block the inquiry would be taken as more evidence of obstruction. The House speaker said: \u201cThe White House letter is only the latest attempt to cover up his betrayal of our democracy, and to insist that the President is above the law ... Mr President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.\u201d All of this puts the White House and the House of Representatives on a collision course over how to read the Constitution that could set a precedent for decades to comes. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will sign an executive order on transparency in federal guidance and enforcement at 3.15pm ET. Mike Pence is in Iowa for a campaign event with Republican senator Joni Ernst and a discussion on trade. Joe Biden is campaigning in New Hampshire today. That\u2019s all still coming up, so stay tuned.",
