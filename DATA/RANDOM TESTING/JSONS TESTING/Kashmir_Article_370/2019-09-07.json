With parliament due to be suspended by next Thursday at the latest, it now appears unlikely Johnson will succeed in his bid to force an election before 31 October \u2013 unless he takes the nuclear option of resigning. After a tumultuous week for the prime minister, the rebels\u2019 pact came as: \u2022 Former justice secretary David Gauke warned that Johnson risked turning the Conservative party into \u201cFarage-lite\u201d. \u2022 The backbench bill aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit completed its passage through the House of Lords, clearing the way for it to receive royal assent on Monday. \u2022 A scrawled note leaked to Sky News showed Johnson referring to David Cameron as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d. \u2022 Johnson was criticised by the chief constable of West Yorkshire police for using new police recruits as the backdrop for a political speech. \u2022 The prime minister\u2019s first concrete proposal for replacing the Irish backstop hit the buffers following a \u201cdisastrous\u201d meeting between his chief negotiator and the EU in Brussels.

There was further embarrassment after it emerged that Johnson referred to Cameron as a \u201cgirly swot\u201d in a recent cabinet paper. The leak of an unredacted version of court documents to Sky News prompted condemnation of the prime minister for sexist insults. During his inaugural prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Johnson seemed to call Corbyn a \u201cgreat big girl\u2019s blouse\u201d in relation to the Labour leader\u2019s refusal to back an immediate general election. The other reference dates back to 16 August, appearing in a handwritten note about the idea of suspending parliament for five weeks. The document was initially revealed on Thursday by Downing Street as it resisted legal challenges in Edinburgh and London to the prorogation of parliament, both of which cases were eventually won by No 10. In Aberdeenshire on Friday, at the end of a bruising week, Johnson was asked twice whether he would sack his chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, after the former prime minister, Sir John Major, described him as a \u201cpoison\u201d at the heart of government on Thursday night.
