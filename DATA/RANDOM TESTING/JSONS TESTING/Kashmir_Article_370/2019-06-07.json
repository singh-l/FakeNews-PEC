The solitary floe is soon followed by another, then another, then clusters, then swarms, then entire fields of white crazy paving that stretch to the horizon.</p> \n<p>From deck level it is a stunning sight. But from high above, drones and helicopters capture the bigger, more alarming picture: a slow-motion blast pattern of frozen shrapnel radiating from the high Arctic southwards through this strait, which is the interchange of 80% of the water between the ice cap and the world\u2019s oceans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a1399566-d926-42e1-8f88-9df2f2720940\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7GieAsmcNWo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This is where ice floes come to die, and the cemetery is filling faster each year, according to the leader of this scientific expedition, Till Wagner, of the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW).

The natural thaw that starts with spring\u2019s warm weather is being amplified by manmade global heating. The Arctic has heated up by 2C above pre-industrial levels, twice the global average. Some hotspots, including parts of the Fram strait, have warmed by 4C. There are variations from year to year, but the trend is clear and accelerating. Sea ice is melting earlier in the spring and freezing later in the autumn. Each summer it thins more and recedes further, leaving greater expanses of the ocean exposed to 24-hour sunlight. This is driving back the frontiers of ice and fragmenting one of the planet\u2019s most important climate regulators. It is also creating a series of feedbacks that are accelerating the Arctic melt. Several are only partially understood.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ada5e8076801cb88044f6ae1bf74da616b6421a0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada5e8076801cb88044f6ae1bf74da616b6421a0/0_0_6621_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greenpeace\u2019s MV Arctic Sunrise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greenpeace\u2019s MV Arctic Sunrise anchored next to Dahlbreen glacier in Svalbard.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Sinyakov/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The team and crew set out on the <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/21690/greenpeace-launches-pole-to-pole-expedition-in-bid-for-global-ocean-treaty/\">Greenpeace</a> ships <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/explore/ships/arctic-sunrise/\">Arctic Sunrise</a> and <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/explore/ships/esperanza/\">Esperanza</a> from Svalbard\u2019s port at Longyearbyen in May, less than a month after the sea ice reached yet <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2019/04/arctic-in-trouble-sea-ice-melt-falls-to-record-lows-for-early-april/\">another record low</a>. At the start of the melt season, this is a fast-changing body of water. The Greenpeace crew say high winds and strong currents have pushed the ice front southwards by 50 miles in the last four days. The floes appear on the radar screen as a thickening swarm of yellow flies. When the bands of ice cannot be evaded, they are nosed aside by the prow, scraping the hull as we pass. Occasionally, they are smashed through with a clanging jolt.</p> \n<p>The combinations of shade and shape are endlessly varied: here an opal gorge, there an emerald grotto, some floes so perfectly rectangular they could have been cut with a guillotine, others as jagged as a Cornish coastline. Many surfaces are topped with snowy peaks or crenellations; others look as flat as a tennis court. Depending on the sea motion when it was formed, the ice can be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frazil_ice\">frazilled</a> into loose white ice crystals, pancaked into bluish layers, or dense, hard <a href=\"https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glossary/term/nilas\">nilas</a> so transparent that they appear to be black.</p> \n<p>But all the floes have one thing in common: they are steadily diminishing as they head south. On the surface you can see the outliers, tiny translucent chunks that are destined to shrink to the size of an ice cube before they finally melt into the Atlantic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"342d04bf6dea592f6b7fb8bea75ac6274ef2681b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/342d04bf6dea592f6b7fb8bea75ac6274ef2681b/0_0_6493_4329/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Floating ice floes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Floating ice floes along one edge of Fram Strait.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Sinyakov/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Since the start of the satellite era in 1979, the summer Arctic has lost 40% of its extent and up to 70% of its volume, says Wagner. Other scientists calculate the rate of decline at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/military-buildup-in-arctic-as-melting-ice-reopens-northern-borders\">10,000 tonnes a second</a>. Much of the multiyear ice is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/arctics-strongest-sea-ice-breaks-up-for-first-time-on-record\">now gone</a>. Most of what is left is the younger, thinner layer from the previous winter, which is easier for the sun to melt and the wind to push around. Wagner expects ice-free summers in 20 to 40 years, which would allow ships to cruise all the way to the north pole.</p> \n<p>Ice-free summers are 10 times more likely if the world warms by 2C rather than 1.5C, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The body of top international scientists said last year that the Arctic and coral reef systems were the ecosystems at greatest risk.</p> \n<p>The Fram strait is one of the few places in the Arctic where the ice extent has not declined, but that is probably not good news. One of the theories being tested on this trip is whether this is because more ice is being flushed through this channel. The pace of change is mindblowing, Wagner says. \u201cWhat we are looking at is whether this exit is accelerating.\u201d</p> \n<p>The team is also examining other processes to help gauge the health of the ocean and how it is changing. To get a baseline, they conduct tests at intervals along the 79th parallel. First, they identify a suitably sized floe, then an armed polar bear guard ensures there are no predators and checks the solidity of the ice. After the all-clear, a dozen or so scientists and volunteers pull up on motor dinghies to drill, measure, take water samples and extract cores. Every five metres a square trench is shovelled out of the surface snow down to the hard surface of the ice below. All the while, the floe drifts with the current and bobs gently in the swell. On the ship, crew members test the water at different depths for acidity, temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and acidification.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"e90c3af21a491012fb7a9af3e12960faf94277ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e90c3af21a491012fb7a9af3e12960faf94277ca/0_0_6598_4399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Wagner drills\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Till Wagner (right) drills an ice floe in the Fram Strait.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Sinyakov/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the past, the data would have been related only to physics and chemistry, but there is a growing awareness of the crucial climate role played by marine organisms, so biologists are also part of this interdisciplinary team. They scan the horizon for whales, seals and walruses and use tightly meshed zooplankton nets to capture teeming masses of minute shrimp- and wormlike creatures.</p> \n<p>Far more than polar bears, these tiny creatures and the algae on which they graze play an essential role in not just the local ecosystem, but the global climate and food chain, according to a growing body of research. The largest synchronised movement of biomass on the planet is the vertical migration of zooplankton, which happens daily as the tiny creatures move from the depths to surface feeding waters. The area under the ice floes is such a rich source of nutrients that it has been described as an all-you-can-eat buffet for zooplankton.</p> \n<p>Researchers are discovering that the floes are home to an extraordinary variety and abundance of life, even during the four-month darkness of Arctic winter. Depending on how the ice is formed, it can be permeable and elastic, with space inside that can be colonised by bacteria, fungal spores and the tiny creatures that feed on them such as the transparent jellyfish <em>Sympagohydra tuuli</em>, which squeezes inside the cracks in the ice to hunt for food.

For centuries, the Arctic\u2019s distinctive character has been shaped by a layer of cold, relatively fresh water just below the surface, produced by melting ice and glaciers. This has insulated the sea ice from the warmer, denser, saltier waters of the Atlantic currents that flow in the depth.

Atlantic species of cod, herring and mackerel are moving northwards. For the next 20 to 30 years this could boost fishing catches, but forecasts by Norway suggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/25/cod-stocks-on-course-to-crash-if-ocean-warming-continues\">boom will turn to bust</a> later as the waters grow too warm for fish larvae.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/arctic-zip/giv-3902OLXb45BthNgD/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/arctic-zip/giv-3902OLXb45BthNgD/\">Map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>There are signs elsewhere in the Arctic that the arrival of smaller Atlantic copepods may be associated with a decline in the whale populations that rely on them.

      "bodyText": "The demise of an entire ocean is almost too enormous to grasp, but as the expedition sails deeper into the Arctic, the colossal processes of breakdown are increasingly evident. The first fragment of ice appears off the starboard bow a few miles before the 79th parallel in the Fram strait, which lies between Greenland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. The solitary floe is soon followed by another, then another, then clusters, then swarms, then entire fields of white crazy paving that stretch to the horizon. From deck level it is a stunning sight. But from high above, drones and helicopters capture the bigger, more alarming picture: a slow-motion blast pattern of frozen shrapnel radiating from the high Arctic southwards through this strait, which is the interchange of 80% of the water between the ice cap and the world\u2019s oceans. This is where ice floes come to die, and the cemetery is filling faster each year, according to the leader of this scientific expedition, Till Wagner, of the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW). One of the objectives of the expedition is to investigate why the collapse of Arctic ice is happening faster than climate computer models predict and to understand what this augurs for the rest of the planet. The melt is not simply a seasonal process. The natural thaw that starts with spring\u2019s warm weather is being amplified by manmade global heating. The Arctic has heated up by 2C above pre-industrial levels, twice the global average. Some hotspots, including parts of the Fram strait, have warmed by 4C. There are variations from year to year, but the trend is clear and accelerating. Sea ice is melting earlier in the spring and freezing later in the autumn. Each summer it thins more and recedes further, leaving greater expanses of the ocean exposed to 24-hour sunlight. This is driving back the frontiers of ice and fragmenting one of the planet\u2019s most important climate regulators. It is also creating a series of feedbacks that are accelerating the Arctic melt. Several are only partially understood. The team and crew set out on the Greenpeace ships Arctic Sunrise and Esperanza from Svalbard\u2019s port at Longyearbyen in May, less than a month after the sea ice reached yet another record low. At the start of the melt season, this is a fast-changing body of water. The Greenpeace crew say high winds and strong currents have pushed the ice front southwards by 50 miles in the last four days. The floes appear on the radar screen as a thickening swarm of yellow flies. When the bands of ice cannot be evaded, they are nosed aside by the prow, scraping the hull as we pass. Occasionally, they are smashed through with a clanging jolt. The combinations of shade and shape are endlessly varied: here an opal gorge, there an emerald grotto, some floes so perfectly rectangular they could have been cut with a guillotine, others as jagged as a Cornish coastline. Many surfaces are topped with snowy peaks or crenellations; others look as flat as a tennis court. Depending on the sea motion when it was formed, the ice can be frazilled into loose white ice crystals, pancaked into bluish layers, or dense, hard nilas so transparent that they appear to be black. But all the floes have one thing in common: they are steadily diminishing as they head south. On the surface you can see the outliers, tiny translucent chunks that are destined to shrink to the size of an ice cube before they finally melt into the Atlantic. Since the start of the satellite era in 1979, the summer Arctic has lost 40% of its extent and up to 70% of its volume, says Wagner. Other scientists calculate the rate of decline at 10,000 tonnes a second. Much of the multiyear ice is now gone. Most of what is left is the younger, thinner layer from the previous winter, which is easier for the sun to melt and the wind to push around. Wagner expects ice-free summers in 20 to 40 years, which would allow ships to cruise all the way to the north pole. Ice-free summers are 10 times more likely if the world warms by 2C rather than 1.5C, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The body of top international scientists said last year that the Arctic and coral reef systems were the ecosystems at greatest risk. The Fram strait is one of the few places in the Arctic where the ice extent has not declined, but that is probably not good news. One of the theories being tested on this trip is whether this is because more ice is being flushed through this channel. The pace of change is mindblowing, Wagner says. \u201cWhat we are looking at is whether this exit is accelerating.\u201d The team is also examining other processes to help gauge the health of the ocean and how it is changing. To get a baseline, they conduct tests at intervals along the 79th parallel. First, they identify a suitably sized floe, then an armed polar bear guard ensures there are no predators and checks the solidity of the ice. After the all-clear, a dozen or so scientists and volunteers pull up on motor dinghies to drill, measure, take water samples and extract cores. Every five metres a square trench is shovelled out of the surface snow down to the hard surface of the ice below. All the while, the floe drifts with the current and bobs gently in the swell. On the ship, crew members test the water at different depths for acidity, temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and acidification. In the past, the data would have been related only to physics and chemistry, but there is a growing awareness of the crucial climate role played by marine organisms, so biologists are also part of this interdisciplinary team. They scan the horizon for whales, seals and walruses and use tightly meshed zooplankton nets to capture teeming masses of minute shrimp- and wormlike creatures. Far more than polar bears, these tiny creatures and the algae on which they graze play an essential role in not just the local ecosystem, but the global climate and food chain, according to a growing body of research. The largest synchronised movement of biomass on the planet is the vertical migration of zooplankton, which happens daily as the tiny creatures move from the depths to surface feeding waters. The area under the ice floes is such a rich source of nutrients that it has been described as an all-you-can-eat buffet for zooplankton. Researchers are discovering that the floes are home to an extraordinary variety and abundance of life, even during the four-month darkness of Arctic winter. Depending on how the ice is formed, it can be permeable and elastic, with space inside that can be colonised by bacteria, fungal spores and the tiny creatures that feed on them such as the transparent jellyfish Sympagohydra tuuli, which squeezes inside the cracks in the ice to hunt for food. The green and yellow shades at the base of floes indicate the presence of phytoplankton \u2013 algae that use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and energy. These are the pastures on which the zooplankton graze. Most important among them are copepods, a fat-filled staple in the diet of whales and fish. Together, millions of these species form an oceanic pump, says Mattias Cape, a biological oceanographer with the University of Washington.
