Yes to a short extension on condition that the prime minister passes her deal through the Commons. But beyond that it is utterly complicated. It cannot be done without British MEPs having been elected.\u201d The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, told the Guardian: \u201cThere will be a problem with June. It is absolutely not in the interests of the European Union for it to beyond the date of the European elections.\u201d Unusually, draft council conclusions \u2013 the summit communique issued at the end of meetings of the leaders \u2013 were not circulated among the ambassadors. Sources said the EU\u2019s leaders would have a freewheeling debate about the extension request. The position taken by the ambassadors represents a shift in mood of the member states, who had been reluctant to accept the European commission\u2019s conclusion that an extension could not go beyond 23 May without British MEPs being elected. The EU\u2019s legal service had indicated that 1 July was the real \u201clegal backstop\u201d for an extension, as the parliament convenes on 2 July. But the chaos in Westminster has convinced the EU capitals of the dangers that the UK would end up remaining a member state beyond even then without British MEPs having been elected. Such a result could leave the EU\u2019s institutions in \u201cparalysis\u201d, the bloc\u2019s lawyers have advised. The prime minister\u2019s insistence, in her letter seeking an extension and in the Commons, that she would not hold elections while in Downing Street helped to crystallise the EU\u2019s thinking, sources said. The ambassadors on Wednesday night agreed that the Strasbourg papers, in which the EU has offered fresh assurances over the temporary nature of the Irish backstop, would be adopted by the leaders. There was a debate among the diplomats over whether the EU would write a date into their summit communique on Thursday, and it was eventually agreed that they should. There remains a chance that the extension could be even shorter than 22 May, as the British authorities would need time to organise elections. But a delay of a few weeks would be likely to solve little, senior diplomats argued. \u201cIt would be useless,\u201d said one. Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister, said it was time for May to work cross-party to find a majority. \u201cThe problem is that Brexit is not being treated as an existential crisis on the table of British politics but as an element in a war between the Conservatives and Labour,\u201d he said.",
