Lord Ahmed, 61, was charged this month with two counts of attempted rape and one count of indecent assault in the early 1970s. He entered no pleas during the 10-minute hearing but his solicitor, Haroon Shah, said he would be pleading not guilty to all the charges. Ahmed appeared at Sheffield magistrates court charged under his full name, along with two of his brothers. Mohamed Farouq, 68, from Rotherham, is charged with four counts of indecent assault against a boy under 14. Mohammed Tariq, 63, also from Rotherham, is charged with two counts of indecent assault against a boy under 14. The charges against Ahmed relate to two complainants \u2013 a boy and a girl \u2013 and to alleged incidents between 1971 and 1974, when he was a teenager. The indecent assault charge relates to a boy under 14. Ahmed stood in the dock with his brothers, wearing a dark suit and navy tie. He spoke to confirm his name, date of birth, address and his nationality as British. Farouq and Tariq entered not guilty pleas during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. All three men were granted bail to appear at Sheffield crown court on 16 April. Ahmed was born in Pakistan-governed Kashmir but his political roots are in Rotherham, where he grew up and still lives. Educated locally, he joined the Labour party at 18 and served for a decade on Rotherham metropolitan borough council.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s government has been plunged into constitutional chaos after the Speaker blocked the prime minister from asking MPs to vote on her Brexit deal for a third time unless it had fundamentally changed. With 11 days to go until Britain is due to leave the EU, May was forced to pull her plans for another meaningful vote because John Bercow said she could not ask MPs to pass the same deal, after they rejected it twice by huge margins. EU officials, meanwhile, were considering offering her a new date for a delayed Brexit to resolve the crisis. Quoting from the guide to parliamentary procedure, Erskine May, Bercow said the question \u201cmay not be brought forward again during the same session\u201d and that it was a \u201cstrong and longstanding convention\u201d dating back to 1604. It must be \u201cnot different in terms of wording, but different in terms of substance\u201d, he said, suggesting there must be a change in what the EU is offering. Bercow\u2019s surprise intervention means May is likely to have to go to Thursday\u2019s Brussels summit with a request for a long extension to article 50, which could mean the UK has to spend more than \u00a3100m on participating in European parliament elections. During the delay, parliament would have to make a decision on how to break the deadlock, potentially with a second referendum, an election or a cross-party proposal for a softer Brexit. Alternatively, government sources suggested May could negotiate a lengthy extension with the EU, with a \u201cget-out clause\u201d enabling it to be cut short if her Brexit deal is passed by parliament before the European parliamentary elections. One option under consideration is some kind of \u201cpaving vote\u201d to set aside the convention if a majority in the House of Commons agreed they wanted to look at the deal again. Sources in Brussels suggested the EU may offer May a helping hand by agreeing on a new delayed Brexit date at the summit, which could allow her to argue next week that the deal is sufficiently different to merit a third vote in parliament. Some hardline Conservative Brexit supporters were pleased that May\u2019s efforts to pass her deal were being frustrated, hoping the EU would veto an extension and the UK would be forced to exit without a deal on 29 March. Government sources downplayed such a scenario, saying the EU was highly likely to grant an extension. A government source said: \u201cIt seems clear that the Speaker\u2019s motive here is to rule out a meaningful vote this week, which also stands in the way of a securing a shorter extension. \u201cIt leads you to believe what he really wants is a longer extension, where parliament will take over the process and force a softer form of Brexit. But anyone who thinks that this makes no deal more likely is mistaken \u2013 the Speaker wouldn\u2019t have done it if it did.\u201d No 10 and ministers were locked in debate on Monday night on how to get around the Speaker\u2019s ruling in order to have another meaningful vote next week. The government was initially blindsided by Bercow\u2019s pronouncement and unable to comment on what May would do next as it had not been \u201cforewarned\u201d. By Monday evening they would only say that the government \u201cnoted\u201d the Speaker\u2019s statement, adding: \u201cThis is something that requires proper consideration.\u201d But supporters of May\u2019s deal were openly furious, with Robert Buckland, who as solicitor general is one of May\u2019s chief law officers, saying it amounted to a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d. He suggested No 10 might have to consider the drastic step of ending the parliamentary session early and restarting a new session, although government sources suggested this would not be an easy option. \u201cFrankly we could have done without this, but it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to negotiate with and deal with,\u201d he told BBC News. Another minister, Rory Stewart, appeared to liken the Speaker to Humpty Dumpty saying his attitude was that a rule \u201cmeans just what I choose it to mean\u201d. Other senior government figures described Downing St as being in a state of shock. \u201cIt\u2019s miserable,\u201d one said. \u201cI think the first thing is the government having to come to terms with it.\u201d A number of Conservative MPs said they suspected Bercow\u2019s underlying reason for refusing another vote this week was an attempt to bounce the government into seeking a longer extension to article 50 from the EU, allowing parliament to seize control of the Brexit process. However, others suggested the Speaker\u2019s ruling could be helpful to May because there was little chance her deal would have passed this week anyway.
