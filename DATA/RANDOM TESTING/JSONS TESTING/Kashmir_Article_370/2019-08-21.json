Tensions remain high in the region, where there is a heavy security presence on the streets and a continued block on mobile and internet services. In Kashmir\u2019s main city, Srinagar, posters appeared overnight urging people to defy a ban on public gatherings and join a mass march after Friday prayers this week to protest against Delhi\u2019s decision to strip the region of its autonomy.

Last week, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, threatened to \u201cteach Delhi a lesson\u201d and vowed to fight until the end against any Indian violations in disputed Kashmir.

Indian officials said one of its soldiers died and four were wounded after fire from Pakistani troops along the de-facto border, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. Delhi, which has always refused third-party mediation over Kashmir, accuses Pakistan of fuelling terrorist activity in the region. Kashmir police said a man who they said was affiliated with Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group, was killed in an operation by security teams in Baramulla, northern Kashmir. One officer was also killed and another was receiving hospital treatment. The suspected militant is not believed to have been a prominent figure in LeT, which is designated a terrorist organisation by the UN and has been blamed by the US and India for the Mumbai attacks in 2008, which killed more than 160 people. Khalid Shah, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, an Indian-based thinktank, said it was unlikely officials would pursue high-profile militants as their deaths would risk attracting large funeral crowds. Clashes are common between Indian security forces and militants in Kashmir, where an insurgency has been fought against Indian rule for decades. However, such actions appeared to have halted after the revocation of Kashmir\u2019s special status, and officials were focused on maintaining law and order by enforcing a strict curfew. \u201cFor two weeks the government deliberately didn\u2019t conduct any operations and now there is a clear indication that they want to have an aggressive security stance against the militant groups and to make sure they are on the defensive,\u201d Shah said.
