Historically, land which was gifted by nature has been forcefully appropriated into private ownership by a ruling minority who subsequently deny access to the majority. Land ownership is the key capital asset to the generation and distribution of money wealth, which has led to the polarisation of society into owners and workers, rich and poor. This maldistribution of wealth can only be addressed by returning land to the principle of the commons. Freehold could then become a form of leasehold with the rent generated being distributed in the form of a citizens\u2019 dividend in return for their loss of access.

That\u2019s why Ramblers are campaigning for the new agriculture bill (which will replace the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy after Brexit) to improve people\u2019s access to the countryside. As George states, landowners currently receive subsidies by the hectare. Any new agriculture bill must make clear that landowners should only receive payments from the public purse if they fulfil their existing range of legal duties regarding the protection of public rights of way \u2013 which include keeping routes clear of obstruction and maintaining stiles and gates.
