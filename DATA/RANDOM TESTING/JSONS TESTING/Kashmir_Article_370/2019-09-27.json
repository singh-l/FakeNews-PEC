      "bodyText": "Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, warned last night that India\u2019s actions in Kashmir could cause a \u201cbloodbath\u201d in the region and provoke war between the two nuclear-armed countries. In an address to the United Nations general assembly in New York, Khan described the situation in Kashmir as a test for the UN and warned that a conflict between India and Pakistan would have \u201cconsequences far beyond the borders\u201d. Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir, responded furiously to Delhi\u2019s decision in August to strip Indian-administered Kashmir of its special status. It has urged the global community to intervene, and said Kashmiris were being treated like animals. Kashmir, already one of the world\u2019s most heavily militarised regions, was flooded with extra troops and placed under curfew ahead of its loss of special status. Thousands of people have reportedly been arrested as part of a security crackdown. Most travel restrictions have since been removed, but mobile and internet services remain suspended. Khan said India\u2019s actions would radicalise Kashmiris and increase the likelihood of a terrorist attack. \u201cThere will be a reaction to this, Pakistan will be blamed, two nuclear-armed countries will come face to face like we came in February,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a conventional war starts, anything could happen.

Modi\u2019s comments instead focused on the India\u2019s efforts to protect the environment and development issues such as healthcare. He also called for unity in tackling terrorism, adding that India\u2019s \u201cvoice against terrorism to alert the world about its evil rings with seriousness and outrage\u201d. On Thursday the senior US diplomat for south Asia called for a calming of rhetoric between India and Pakistan, saying Washington hoped to see rapid action by India to lift restrictions on Kashmir and the release of detainees there. The two countries came to the brink of war in February after a suicide bomber blew up a convoy of more than 40 Indian soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir. India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region. Residents of Indian-controlled Kashmir expressed hope that the UN speeches would turn world attention to the unprecedented lockdown in the region. \u201cWe really hope these leaders will do something to rid us of conflict and suppression,\u201d said Nazir Ahmed, a schoolteacher on the outskirts of Srinagar. \u201cConflict is like a cancer hitting every aspect of life.
