The unprecedented cancellation of all flights followed the fourth consecutive day of protests at the airport amid increasingly threatening statements from Beijing. A Chinese official said \u201cterrorism\u201d was emerging in the city, while in Hong Kong authorities demonstrated water cannons for use in crowd control. The protests are in their 10th week, with confrontations between protesters and police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/12/hong-kong-police-britain-arms-protests-boris-johnson\">growing more violent</a>. At least 40 people were treated in hospital after clashes on Sunday, including a woman who was hit, reportedly with a beanbag round, and could potentially lose an eye. </p> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s cities are straining under the weight of the country\u2019s rapid population growth,</strong> with a major audit finding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/13/600bn-of-spending-needed-over-next-15-years-infrastructure-australia-says\">$600bn in new spending</a> is needed to keep pace with demand over the next 15 years. The audit by Infrastructure Australia found that infrastructure is being particularly stretched on the urban fringes of Australia\u2019s four largest cities \u2013 Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth \u2013 where the majority of the country\u2019s population boom is occurring. The problem is being compounded by ageing assets, rising road congestion, public transport crowding and growing demands on so-called \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d, such as schools, hospitals and parks, as more people move into cities. The IA report warns that in order for Australia to cope with forecast population growth, spending on infrastructure will need to remain at about $40bn a year.</p> <p><strong>An Australian coalmine has nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years without penalty,</strong> under a Coalition climate policy that promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/13/coal-mine-increases-greenhouse-gas-emissions-without-penalty-foi-reveals\">to put a limit on industrial pollution</a>. Anglo American has been given the green light to increase emissions at its Moranbah North mine twice since 2016, according to documents released under freedom of information laws. The pollution increase was approved under a scheme known as the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d, which promised to ensure cuts paid for by taxpayers through the government\u2019s \u201cdirect action\u201d emissions reduction fund were not just wiped out by rises elsewhere. The Australian Conservation Foundation said the failure to impose a hard pollution cap on big companies was the main reason national emissions were rising each year at odds with the government\u2019s pledge at the Paris climate summit.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52587bb1895a647b7e92d833be9d2d2e8c0cceaa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52587bb1895a647b7e92d833be9d2d2e8c0cceaa/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of a forest fire in Boguchar District\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of a forest fire in Boguchar District.

The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian saw three people who had sustained injuries from pellet guns on Friday, but was unable to confirm the total number of people wounded.

In Srinagar, Kashmir\u2019s main city, Indian troops reportedly allowed some residents to walk to local mosques alone or in pairs, but areas of the city were almost entirely deserted on what is usually one of the biggest celebrations of the year. Blocks on landlines, mobile phones, the internet and cable TV, introduced last Monday, continued. Authorities said the restrictions were in place to avoid unrest. Last week 10,000 people reportedly took to the streets of Srinagar to protest against Delhi\u2019s decision to revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status. Government forces reportedly opened fire and used teargas. The Indian ministry of home affairs denied that any protests of more than 20 people took place \u2013 though TV footage appeared to show very large crowds chanting: \u201cGo back, go, India, go.\u201d The Guardian saw three people who had sustained injuries from pellet guns on Friday, but was unable to confirm the total number of people wounded. Hospitals have apparently been warned not to disclose patient numbers. \u201cOur hearts are on fire,\u201d said Habibullah Bhat, 75, who told Associated Press on Monday that he came to offer prayers despite his ill health. \u201cIndia has thrown us into the dark ages, but God is on our side and our resistance will win.\u201d A spokesperson for the Indian home affairs ministry said on Monday that prayers had gone ahead peacefully in local mosques in various parts of the state \u201cwithout any untoward incident\u201d.

The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cJamia Masjid old town Baramulla witnessed approx 10,000 people offering prayers,\u201d the spokesperson said on Twitter.

      "bodyText": "Large congregations have been banned for the major Islamic festival of Eid in Indian-administered Kashmir, where an unprecedented communications block on landlines, mobile and the internet remained in place for an eighth day. Residents have been allowed to visit their local mosque, according to Indian officials, but the communications block means they have been unable to call relatives. Large congregations were banned in an apparent attempt to avoid anti-India protests. A spokesperson for the Indian home affairs ministry said prayers had gone ahead peacefully in all local mosques in Anantnag, Baramulla, Budgam and Bandipore \u201cwithout any untoward incident\u201d. \u201cJamia Masjid old town Baramulla witnessed approx 10,000 people offering prayers,\u201d the spokesperson said on Twitter. It was not immediately possible to independently confirm the claim. India\u2019s foreign ministry shared photos of people visiting mosques, but a spokesman was not able to specify where the photos were taken within Jammu and Kashmir, which New Delhi downgraded from a state to two federal territories a week ago.
