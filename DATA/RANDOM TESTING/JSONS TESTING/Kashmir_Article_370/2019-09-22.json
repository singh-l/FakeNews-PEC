      "bodyText": "As one of the few British Asian professional footballers, Kashif Siddiqi has overcome more than just opponents on the pitch in his quest to fulfil his dream. But now the defender is preparing for his toughest challenge yet as he swaps Oxford United for one of the world\u2019s most militarised and politically contentious regions where he will ply his trade for Real Kashmir, the only professional football club in Indian-administered Kashmir. The unorthodox loan move will see Siddiqi take to the field in a nuclear flashpoint flooded by almost 800,000 troops, who have placed the state in lockdown after the Indian government revoked its special status. It has further fuelled an armed insurgency, which has been raging for more than 30 years and has resulted in a bitter standoff between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir as their own. At the same time, their respective armies have been regularly exchanging fire, resulting in more than 100 deaths this year. \u201cIt\u2019s not your typical football loan move, but then I don\u2019t really do normal.
