      "bodyText": "Time for a recap The pound has surged after Theresa May finally conceded that MPs should be given a vote on whether to extend Article 50, rather than crash out of the EU without a deal in a month\u2019s time. Sterling has jumped by around 1% against the euro to a 21-month high, around \u20ac1.164, and to a five-month high against the US dollar at $1.324. City traders are calculating that a disorderly Brexit is less likely, while there\u2019s still a chance that May\u2019s deal is eventually approved by MPs (although there wasn\u2019t much support for it in parliament today). Business leaders, though, fear that they could faces another cliff edge this summer - if MPs only approve a short extension. The Bank of England is getting ready for market volatility, by launching new weekly liquidity auctions. They will help banks and building societies get their hands on sterling, in the event of a squeeze after a no-deal Brexit. BoE governor Mark Carney warned that growth would suffer if Britain crashes out without a transition deal, adding that the country doesn\u2019t have enough warehouses to handle stock-piling demands. In an prize-example of non-preparedness, Britain has discovered that it doesn\u2019t even have enough suitable pallets to trade with the EU, if it leaves without a deal. In Washington, Jerome Powell has emphasised that the US Federal Reserve will be patient when considering future interest rate moves. Our Politics Liveblog is tracking all the action on Brexit: Goodnight! GW Jay Powell has tried to sidestep a question about political interference. Asked if anybody at the White House had communicated with him \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d about interest rates, Powell would only say that it wasn\u2019t appropriate to discuss private conversations with any other government officials. Obviously the Federal Reserve is meant to be independent, and free from meddling. However, that ship sailed once Donald Trump started blasting the Fed\u2019s politics on Twitter. Sterling\u2019s surge has dragged down stock prices of UK multinationals who have large overseas earnings, such as British American Tobacco (down 2%). This has helped the FTSE 100 to underperform other European markets. The blue-chip index has closed down 32 points, while the German DAC gained 0.3% and France\u2019s CAC also closed higher. Back in Washington, Jerome Powell has poured some cold water on Modern Monetary Theory (MMT). This is the idea that a government which controls its own currency can always fund its spending plans, regardless of deficit levels, and isn\u2019t reliant on borrowing in the markets. It\u2019s becoming a hot topic, as US politicians push policies such as the New Green Deal. Powell tells the Senate banking committee that he hasn\u2019t seen a detailed explanation of how MMT would work in practice, but that the idea that deficits don\u2019t matter is wrong. Here\u2019s Guy Foster, Brewin Dolphin\u2019s Head of Research, on today\u2019s Brexit developments: \u201cTheresa May must feel more like a seamstress than a prime minister given how much time she spends trying to knit together opposing camps within her party. By offering a short extension she has effectively weakened the means by which Parliament could demand a long extension. There will be no majority for a no deal Brexit whereas an extension should pass.\u201d Back in the markets, sterling is banging out new highs against other major currencies. The pound has now hit \u20ac1.166 against the euro, up 1% or 1.3 eurocents today. That\u2019s a fresh 21-month high against the single currency. Sterling is also rampant against the US dollar, up more than one and a half cents to $1.326. That\u2019s the highest since September 2018. This comes after several prominent MPs welcomed Theresa May\u2019s pledge for a vote to extend Article 50 next month, if her deal doesn\u2019t pass. It appears that the Cooper-Letwin amendment, to formally rule out a No-Deal Brexit, might not be voted on tomorrow after all, as it\u2019s no longer needed. My colleague Jessica Elgot explains: Jay Powell is now giving Senators a lesson on the US labor market, and the risk that people earn less in a new job than they\u2019d get on welfare: Jay Powell has warned the Senate that it would be a very serious mistake not to raise the USA debt ceiling. The Fed chair says it would be a \u201cvery big deal\u201d if America was unable to repay its bills, causing serious negative impact to the economy. Jay Powell is now taking questions from members of the Senate banking committee in Washington. On the economic outlook, he says the Fed wants to use its tools to sustain the current expansion. On energy, he says America\u2019s shale industry is a \u201creal positive\u201d. Because shale producers pump more oil when prices rise, it acts as a \u201cshock-absorber\u201d to prevent inflation getting out of control as in the 1970. On trade, Powell warns that \u201cuncertainty is the enemy of business.\u201d The Fed has been hearing for months that the uncertainty over America\u2019s trade links (due to the dispute with China) has had some impact on confidence. And on US financial stability, he says America\u2019s banks are strong - with no bank failures in 2018. Jay Powell has also taken the opportunity to tell Congress that America has too much economic inequality, and too much debt too. He\u2019s challenging Senators to do more to help their citizens, saying: Productivity growth, which is what drives rising real wages and living standards over the longer term, has been too low. Likewise, in contrast to 25 years ago, labor force participation among prime-age men and women is now lower in the United States than in most other advanced economies. Other longer-run trends, such as relatively stagnant incomes for many families and a lack of upward economic mobility among people with lower incomes, also remain important challenges. And it is widely agreed that federal government debt is on an unsustainable path. As a nation, addressing these pressing issues could contribute greatly to the longer-run health and vitality of the U.S. economy. Fed chair Jerome Powell also cites Brexit as a key source of uncertainty that could threaten financial markets. He tells the Senate banking committee that the mood in the world economy has darkened: Financial markets became more volatile toward year-end, and financial conditions are now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year. Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly China and Europe. And uncertainty is elevated around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit and ongoing trade negotiations. We will carefully monitor these issues as they evolve. Newsflash: America\u2019s top central banker, Jerome Powell, is starting to give his bi-annual testimony to the US Senate. And the top line is that Powell is reiterating that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t rush to raise US interest rates. Echoing the message from the Fed\u2019s last meeting, a month ago, Powell says: In January, with inflation pressures muted, the FOMC determined that the cumulative effects of these developments, along with ongoing government policy uncertainty, warranted taking a patient approach with regard to future policy changes. Going forward, our policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and will take into account new information as economic conditions and the outlook evolve. Powell also says that the US jobs market remains \u2018strong\u2019, with low-skilled workers getting the highest wage growth recently. Brexit has already cast a cloud over UK investors, who are now the gloomiest in Europe, according to new research from UBS Global Wealth Management. UBS has found that City investors are much more anxious than those in rival financial centres like Frankfurt or Paris, even though the eurozone economy has weakened in recent quarters. Nick Tucker, Head of UK Domestic at UBS Wealth Management, explains: \u201cAs we get closer to the UK\u2019s official departure from the EU at the end of March, this survey shows that political turbulence is dragging on investor sentiment in the UK compared to the rest of the region. UK investors seem to have dramatically lowered expectations for 2019 in almost every sense, from expected financial returns to their outlook for the economy.\u201d \u201cFrom our conversations with clients up and down the country, we know that investors are anxious. Here are the main findings from the report: The domestic political environment is the top concern for over half (55%) of UK investors, compared to 43% among EMEA investors Less than one third of UK investors (28%) are now optimistic in their outlook for the European economy over next 12 months, compared to over half of EMEA investors (53%) A quarter of business owners are pessimistic about the outlook for their business in 2019, compared to 12% of EMEA investors Investors advised to maintain exposure to sterling and UK assets at benchmark levels Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit suspects that today\u2019s offer is just another attempt by the PM to get her deal over the line: The boss of Vauxhall\u2019s parent company, PSA, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to \u2018unpopular\u2019 decisions, such as job cuts and factory closures. Carlos Tavares warned this morning: \u201cWe can go on the dark side, say, well, perhaps you have to shut down plants and things like that. Well, if we have to make unpopular decisions we will.\u201d Tavares also warned that a disorderly Brexit would disrupt supply chains at Vauxhall, which employs hundreds of people in Luton, and at Ellesmere Port in the North West. Here\u2019s Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General: \u201cMoves to avert no deal in March are essential. There are now proposals from Parliament and Government. But they are just one step. To avoid a hammer blow to firms and livelihoods, delay cannot simply be an extension of stalemate. Compromise is the only way.\u201d Claire Walker, co-executive director at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), has warned business leaders to keep preparing for all Brexit possibilities: \u201cThe overriding priority is still to assure businesses and communities that an unwanted \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario will not happen by default on March 29th. \u201cBusinesses still need to ensure they are preparing for all possible scenarios and government and its agencies must provide clear, precise and accurate information for all eventualities.\u201d Edwin Morgan, interim Director General of the Institute of Directors, has welcomed Theresa May\u2019s commitment to let MPs vote on extending Article 50. Morgan also warned that most UK firms simply aren\u2019t ready for a no-deal Brexit (not least if they need a pallet to ship goods to Europe!). \u201cThe Prime Minister is right to put her cards on the table for what happens if she fails to get approval for a withdrawal deal by 12 March. Parliament must feel and accept the weight of responsibility that is on their shoulders. The message from our members is clear, nearly 80% would choose to avoid a no-deal outcome. Too much information about that scenario is still missing \u2013 including from our own Government \u2013 for firms to be ready in a few short weeks. \u201cSeeing the impasse continue may not be comfortable for businesses, but a disorderly exit could bring unbearable disruption for firms in sectors from farming to finance, manufacturing to business services, across the UK. It is a long time since we have been in a world of easy choices, and while an extension is not an end in itself, it may become a necessity to achieve an orderly exit.\u201d Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has put his finger on the problem with May\u2019s announcement -- a short A50 extension creates the risk of crashing out in June, rather than March. The pound wobbled during Theresa May\u2019s statement, as the PM made it clear that she didn\u2019t want to see Brexit delayed - even though she\u2019s finally accepted that it could be pushed beyond 29th March. But it\u2019s still clinging onto its 21-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.162, and a four-month high against the US dollar at $1.32. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets says May has pushed UK\u2019s fate onto the cliff edge: She has said \u2018chose between my deal or delay the Brexit\u2019. This political circus has become a real joke. Investors do not need uncertainty and there was a lot of optimism in the market because investors were thinking that no deal scenario is off the table, but now, it seems like it is still on the table. And as Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam points out, UK businesses won\u2019t relish the prospect of more uncertainty. Theresa May is giving a Brexit statement to the House of Commons right now. And the Big News is that parliament will hold up to THREE votes on Brexit in two week\u2019s time. May outlines her plan: The government will hold a second meaningful vote on the PM\u2019s Withdrawal Deal by 12 March at the latest. If the government doesn\u2019t win a meaningful vote, it will table a motion on 13 March to ask whether the House supports leaving the EU on 29th March without a deal. If MPs reject leaving without a deal, the government will hold a vote on a \u201cshort, limited\u201d extension to Article 50 on March 14th. But the PM also warns that she doesn\u2019t want to see Article 50 extended, saying a short extension would create an even sharper cliff edge this summer. And a long extension would mean taking part in the next elections for the European Parliament in May (hardly what Leave voters wanted). Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action: With Mark Carney\u2019s hearing now over, Royal Bank of Canada have spotted that the probability of Brexit happening on time has fallen to just 14% (as implied by odds on Betfair, anyway). Instead, an exit in April-June now looks most likely, followed by no Brexit at all. RBC\u2019s Adam Cole adds that a 2nd referendum looks more likely, but still isn\u2019t at all certain, writing: There is little doubt that Labour support for a second referendum is a necessary condition for such a referendum happening, but it is far from sufficient. That the implied probability of second referendum happening has also risen (second chart; now around 33%) is not surprising, but again there are limits to how far this can run. In particular, it seems highly unlikely that an amendment that backed a second referendum would make it through the Commons, given that there is little support on the government benches and many Labour MPs in Brexit-voting constituencies are also opposed. Q: If the pound fell after a no-deal Brexit, wouldn\u2019t that boost growth? Mark Carney stamps, firmly, on the notion that crashing out of the EU would be good for the economy. The role of a flexible exchange rate is to act as a shock-absorber. A no-deal, no transition Brexit would be a shock, it would be a negative shock. He cites BoE forecasts that a smooth transition to WTO trading terms would lead to the pound plunging by between 8.5% and 10%, and a 2.5% drop in GDP compared to last November\u2019s forecasts. So the weaker currency is \u201can offset, but it is swamped, overwhelmed by the loss of trade access,\u201d the governor explains. Asked about consumer spending, Mark Carney replies that consumers are making fewer big-ticket purchases such as houses and cars, but overall consumption growth has held up well. He also says the Bank isn\u2019t picking up any material sign that households are stockpiling ahead of Brexit (some families have been stocking up on pharmaceuticals products, food, and pet supplies). Q: Consumer confidence and spending, especially in Leave areas, has been consistently more positive than economist forecasts. Does that suggest economists are too pessimistic about Brexit, or has the impact of Brexit simply not hit people yet? Governor Carney says we don\u2019t know what form Brexit will take, and how long it will take to get there, so you can\u2019t make that judgement yet. Heads-up: Just fixed a typo in that 11.17am post -- Mark Carney predicted that the Bank\u2019s GROWTH forecasts will be lower after a no-deal Brexit. Q: Why are some businesses much more worried about Brexit than others? MPC member Dr Gertjan Vlieghe explains that the effects are very unevenly distributed across the economy. A specialist manufacturer which buys basic raw materials, such as chemicals or steel, and turns it into a high-value product won\u2019t be particularly affected by Brexit. But Brexit is an \u201cexistential\u201d issue to a company that is part of a major automotive supply chain, Vleighe adds. Q: Are there enough warehouses to handle the stock-piling necessary for a no-deal Brexit? No there are not, Mark Carney replies, saying that one of the issues facing UK firms is a shortage of warehouse space. There\u2019s a limit to warehousing capacity, and also how much you can stockpile to keep factories running, he adds, citing the just-in-time \u201clean supply chains\u201d used by the car industry and aerospace manufacturers. Q: So we\u2019re looking at chaos? Carney declines to use that particular word, saying only that it would be an economic shock. Mark Carney then warns MPs that growth will suffer if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. The Treasury Committee is now grilling governor Mark Carney over the prospect of Brexit delay. Carney warns that simply kicking the can down the road isn\u2019t as good for the economy as reaching a deal, saying: There\u2019s a big difference between an extension of Article 50, even a long extension, and an agreement with a transition to a known end stage. Wherever we\u2019re headed, it would serve the economy well to have a transition period to that new world, so that people knew soon where they\u2019re headed, businesses could reorganise their affairs and get ready for this new world, and government could finish its tasks. Carney also points out that Brexit uncertainty will linger well beyond Britain\u2019s day of departure (as Westminster will need to negotiate a future relationship with Brussels, and strike new trade deals with the rest of the world). Back in parliament, Charlie Elphicke MP asks Mark Carney about a recent speech calling Brexit an \u2018acid test\u2019 for the new world order. Q: How can Brexit could be used to enhance Britain\u2019s openness, competitiveness and productivity, and rebalance the economy? \u201cFantastic\u201d, mutters Carney, when faced with this poser. But the governor makes some good points - about the important of having flexibility to set your own rules on financial stability, rather than simply being a rule taker. But Carney then takes a much wider view, telling the Treasury Committee that there needs to be a \u201creinvestment of economic gains, so that everyone moves up\u201d. He cites the rise in fintech, saying: How do you provide a framework for new financial technology, not just to benefit the City, but also to help small and medium enterprises in Dover, Deal, Dulwich or... Dunfermline. Don\u2019t forget Doncaster, Darlington, and Dorchester, the MPs chant back. Carney\u2019s bigger point is that globalisation is creating problems, so politicians needs to redistribute the gains made in recent decades. He sites the US-China trade war, saying: The tensions in globalisation are actually starting to affect the global outlook. They are bigger, they\u2019re structural, they require a more deliberate response, and it has to balance some element of redistribution and reinvestment of the gains of globalisation. As well as getting the balance between democratic accountability and standards that are high enough - whether for financial stability, product safety, or environmental standards - that we have confidence that we can trade freely. Carney adds that he doesn\u2019t expect a global recession. But the biggest risk that could trigger such a downturn is around globalisation. My personal view is that the challenges around trade globally have structural drivers. The solution isn\u2019t a textbook solution that \u2018free trade is good\u2019. DOUBLE BOOM! Sterling has just hit a four-month high against the US dollar, touching $1.323 for the first time since mid-October. BOOM! The pound has just hit a 21-month high against the euro, as speculation of a Brexit delay sweeps through the City. Sterling is trading at \u20ac1.162 for the first time since May 2017, up almost one eurocent or 0.8% this morning. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says the the pound is soaring on hopes of a soft Brexit, or a second referendum. Erlam explains that a hard Brexit looks less likely, if Theresa May agrees to take no-deal off the table at today\u2019s cabinet meeting, The pound is tearing higher on Tuesday as we await another vote in Parliament tomorrow \u2013 albeit not on May\u2019s deal, again. The decision comes as the opposition Labour Party threw its support behind a second referendum if it couldn\u2019t get its own Brexit deal over the line and Theresa May opened the door to an extension, having failed to secure amendments with the EU in time for tomorrow\u2019s vote. These are all bullish scenarios for the pound, despite remaining the unlikely options, not only for what they put on the table but also for who they put pressure on. The ERG \u2013 a group of hardline Brexiteers \u2013 many of whom favour a harder Brexit and some no-deal, will not be pleased with the recent developments with another referendum jeopardising the whole process and an extension threatening it. That may force them to reluctantly support May\u2019s deal, when push comes to shove. Sterling has also risen further against the US dollar, over $1.32 for the first time in a month. Our Politics Live blog is covering all the action from Westminster: Treasury committee chair Nicky Morgan brings up another important issue - diversity at the Bank of England. She reminds Mark Carney that he told the Bank\u2019s Court that there was a particular problem with retaining ethnic minority staff, who are underrepresented at every level of the central bank. Morgna also cites a report in the Times last week that BAME staff were more critical of the Bank\u2019s culture -- citing inappropriate language and behaviour, and problems in progressing within the Bank. She says BAME employees perceived a lack of transparency in hiring and firing, and were critical of the Bank\u2019s narrow recruitment base. This is not good. Carney replies that the Bank management take the issue of diversity seriously, and have made considerable progress. In the last five years (since Carney arrived), the proportion of BAME staff at the BoE has risen from 13% to 19%, and from 2% to 5% of senior management. Last year, BAME recruits made up 39% of new hires, Carney adds, citing blind recruitment, inclusive management policies, and pooled hiring decisions. But, he also concedes that the experience for BAME colleagues is \u201cnotably different, notably worse, than for other colleagues\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied with the progress made. It\u2019s not just about numbers. Governor Mark Carney adds that the Bank will provide \u2018all the stimulus it can\u2019 if Britain leaves the EU without a withdrawal deal. Interest rates could either rise or fall in that scenario, he adds, pointing out that a no-deal Brexit will probably be inflationary (as the pound would surely plunge, pushing up import costs). Q: Is the Bank of England more likely to raise, or lower, interest rates after a no-deal Brexit, asks Nicky Morgan MP. It\u2019s clear that the Bank\u2019s top policymakers are split on this issue. MPC member Gertjan Vleighe argues that borrowing costs won\u2019t go up. He tells the Treasury committee that the shock to consumer confidence will be so severe that the Bank will either leave policy unchanged, or cut rates. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden isn\u2019t convinced, though. He fears a supply-shock if Britain crashes out of the EU, with port disruption making imports scarcer. That would drive up inflation, as businesses and consumers scrapped for goods. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is appearing before the Treasury committee now. And he\u2019s started with some news -- the Bank is preparing to pump more liquidity into the UK financial system if needed. With Brexit tensions mounting, the Bank will now hold liquidity auctions every week, rather than monthly, from the start of March until the end of April. Carney tells the committee that this is a prudent and precautionary move. It will allow around 100 banks and building societies to get extra cash in sterling, in return for handing the BoE eligible collateral (a range of financial securities). The Bank of England stands ready to provide liquidity in all major currencies. This would be valuable if the financial system seized up after a disorderly Brexit. Carney insists that the Bank isn\u2019t seeing any liquidity stresses in the market, and that the move is part of \u201cnormal contingency planning\u201d. Carney is appearing along with deputy governor Dave Ramsden and monetary policy committee members Jan Vlieghe and Jonathan Haskel. We\u2019ll watch out for any major developments. Just in: The richest households in the UK saw their income grow last year, while the poorest families got poorer. That\u2019s according to the Office for National Statistics, which has published new income distribution data this morning. It shows that the average income of the poorest fifth of the population contracted by 1.6%, mainly driven by fall in the average value of cash benefits. The average income of the richest fifth, on the other hand, increased by 4.7% due largely to increases in wages. The ONS adds: Over the slightly longer term, it is the average income of the poorest fifth that has risen the most, up 11.6% since 2008, whilst the income of the richest fifth has risen 4.9% over the same period. That\u2019s all well and good... however, a 11.6% increase on a tiny household budget is rather smaller than a 4.9% boost to a City bankers\u2019 wallet. The pound is holding onto its earlier gains, still trading at a one-month high against the euro (at \u20ac1.158) and the US dollar ($1.316). Michael Brown, senior analyst at currency exchange firm Caxton FX, says the prospect of a Brexit extension is supporting sterling: The pound\u2019s gains are a result of markets beginning to price in an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, with reports this morning that the Prime Minister is set to discuss the matter with Cabinet before laying a motion in the Commons this afternoon. Though a delay is simply pushing back the exit date, and doesn\u2019t solve anything itself, markets are taking solace in the fact that such a move would delay a \u2018cliff-edge\u2019 no-deal scenario. Confirmation of such a delay would likely strengthen the pound further in the near-term, though political headwinds remain including the opposition Labour Party calling for a 2nd Brexit referendum In a worrying example of Brexit non-planning, Britain doesn\u2019t have the right sort of pallets to keep trading with the EU if it leaves without a deal. According to Business Insider, the UK government is due to hold emergency talks with industry leaders today after discovering this hitch. The problem is that the EU insists that all pallets entering the bloc from third-countries are heat-treated, to prevent any nasty pests or microbes getting in. That\u2019s not a requirement today (on the grounds that EU countries have similar biological life). So there\u2019s going to be an unseemly scramble for any scarce certified pallets soon, unless Brexit is delayed or Theresa May\u2019s deal is voted through. BI\u2019s Adam Payne says this has come as a nasty shock to the government. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has arranged for a conference call with various figures to take place on Tuesday to discuss the alarming pallet shortage, with just 31 days until Brexit day on March 29. \u201cIt is the tiny, procedural, mundane-seeming stuff that will absolutely trip people up,\u201d one industry figure briefed by Theresa May\u2019s government told BI, adding that the country was \u201cnot even remotely ready\u201d for no-deal. There\u2019s really no excuse for DEFRA not spotting the pallet issue earlier. Last October, Universal Pallets warned that this issue would cause delays for exporters, as it takes time to heat-treat pallets and get them stamped. Dr Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), is urging the government to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Marshall warns that many UK companies - and the government itself - simply aren\u2019t ready for a disorderly exit. \u201cAt this pivotal moment, the government must take decisive steps to avoid the damage that a messy and disorderly exit would cause to business and the economy in just a month\u2019s time. \u201cIt is time to be honest. Government and its agencies are not prepared for a \u2018no deal\u2019 exit on 29th March. Neither are many businesses. \u201cThe overriding priority must be to assure businesses, employees, investors and communities that an unwanted \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario will not be allowed to happen by default on March 29th.\u201d Two weeks ago, the Bank of England reported that HALF UK companies hasn\u2019t drawn up contingency plans for no-deal.... The CBI\u2019s chief, Carolyn Fairbairn, has warned MPs that they need to use any Brexit delay wisely: Bullish traders are piling into the pound this morning, lured by the prospect of a Brexit delay, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Sterling has rallied on movements in the political space that have encouraged the bulls. First, Labour is now backing a second referendum - one u-turn. If anything, though, this just hints at the party worrying about an exodus to The Independent Group. Secondly, and more importantly, there appears to be building pressure on the prime minister to take no deal off the table - another u-turn. If no deal is abandoned, it would likely entail a delay to Brexit, and whilst assuaging concerns about crashing out without a deal in place, it would not remove all the uncertainty. A key cabinet meeting today will reveal all \u2013 we hope. Ouch. UK engineering services group Babcock has warned the City that Brexit will cost it millions of pounds, every year. That\u2019s on top of a \u00a310m bill for restructuring its European aerial business, which provides emergency medical and firefighting services. This will allow it to meet EU rules on ownership, and flying rights, once Britain has left the EU. In a statement to shareholders, the aerospace and defence company says: The UK exiting the EU has resulted in additional costs as we restructure our aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements. There is a one-off tax cost of around \u00a310 million this year and we estimate that additional ongoing costs related to the operation of the new structures will be around \u00a310 million per year. Babcock\u2019s Emergency Medical Services provides air ambulance operators in Europe, and also Australia, and can provide its own doctors and nurses in a emergency. It also operates an Aerial Firefighting division -- increasingly in demand, as climate change leads to more wildfires. Shares in the company, which also refits ships and submarines and decommissions nuclear power stations, have fallen over 3% following today\u2019s news. Roland Rudd, who chairs the People\u2019s Vote campaign, believes a second Brexit referendum is looking more likely. The new Independent Group are also backing the plan: But... some Labour MPs representing constituencies who voted Leave in June 2016 wouldn\u2019t support another referendum, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh tweeted last night: The Financial Times also expects MPs to be offered the chance to delay Brexit, saying: If MPs reject a revised deal in a vote set to take place before March 12, Mrs May will then offer a vote on whether to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit on March 29 or take a \u201cshort extension\u201d of the Article 50 exit process. A Brexit delay now looks that \u201cmost likely path forward\u201d, says Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada. He told City clients this morning: The PM will open the way for a \u201cshort\u201d Brexit delay at a cabinet meeting this morning, according to reports, and outline the terms in her statement to the Commons this afternoon, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s debate. If the meaningful vote by (likely on) March 12 fails, MPs would be given a second vote on leaving with no deal or delaying Brexit which would almost certainly result in delay and this now appears the most likely path forward. We note, however, that proxy markets were yesterday attaching only a 20% probability to Brexit happening \u201con time.\u201d The pound has jumped to its highest level in four weeks this morning, amid speculation that Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union could be delayed. Sterling has rallied half a eurocent against the euro to \u20ac1.158, its highest level since 25th January. That\u2019s nearly a 10-month high. The pound is also strengthening against the US dollar, up half a cent to $1.315, for the first time since the end of January. Last night, The Sun newspaper reported that Theresa May will today propose to Cabinet that she formally rules out a No Deal Brexit on March 29, opening the door to a delay. That could delay Brexit by weeks, or even months, if parliament fails to back her Withdrawal Agreement in the next few weeks. More here: Theresa May to propose to Cabinet today that she formally rules out No-Deal Brexit This would be a dizzying u-turn by the PM, who has long argued that Britain is leaving on the 29th March, come what may. But several cabinet ministers have been piling heavy pressure on May to categorically rule out a no-deal Brexit. Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark are all demanding that May rules out the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU at the end of next month. May insisted yesterday that a delay wouldn\u2019t resolve anything, but the PM risks seeing the issue taken out of her hands. Tomorrow, MPs could pass a cross-party amendment laid by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal scenario. News that the opposition Labour Party have also shifted their position, and could back a public vote on Brexit has also caught the City\u2019s attention -- as it potentially increases the changes that Britain doesn\u2019t leave at all. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reported last night: Jeremy Corbyn has finally thrown his party\u2019s weight behind a second EU referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if Labour should fail to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week. The decision to give the party\u2019s backing to a second referendum follows a concerted push by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, who fear any further delay could have led to more defections to the breakaway Independent Group (TIG), whose members all back a second referendum. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Two top central bankers will be in the spotlight today, facing questions about monetary policy and the state of the economy. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is due before the Treasury Committee at 10am GMT, along with deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden and external policymakers Gertjan Vlieghe and Jonathan Haskel. They\u2019ll be quizzed about the Bank\u2019s latest Inflation Report, which slashed UK growth forecasts and warned a no-deal Brexit could cause a recession. MPs may also ask the Bank about the prospects of interest rate rises over the next couple of years, and the impact of the recent global slowdown on the UK. A few hours later, Carney\u2019s US counterpart will also be facing lawmakers at the Senate. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell\u2019s bi-annual testimony will be extremely closely watched by investors, for any clues on whether the Fed has ended its rate-hiking cycle. He\u2019ll also be asked about plans to trim the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, unwinding its massive stimulus programme, and the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war on the US economy. Markets have risen strongly since the Fed\u2019s last meeting, at the end of January, when it was surprisingly dovish about monetary policy plans; Powell\u2019s comments today could easily move the dollar and US Treasury bond prices. The markets will also be chewing through new US housing data, and consumer confidence report. Plus, UK housebuilder Persimmon is updating the market - reporting that pre-tax profts have jumped to nearly \u00a31.1bn - up from \u00a3970m last year. This is just days after it emerged Persimmon (under fire for paying bosses huge bonuses) could be banned from the government\u2019s Help to Buy subsidy scheme. The agenda 10am GMT: Treasury committee hearing with the Bank of England 1.30pm GMT: US housing starts and permits data for December 2pm GMT: US Case-Shiller index of US house prices in December 3pm GMT: Jerome Powell testifies before the Senate Banking Panel 3pm GMT: US consumer confidence index",

EU sources stress the EU has no fixed position on how long the Brexit extension should last. \u201cWe would pay a lot of attention to the business continuity argument,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cWe have a number of important decisions this year and we cannot allow the mess of Brexit to pollute the decisions of the union.\u201d Brussels is sceptical that a divided Commons would find in three months the consensus that has eluded MPs for more than two and half years. \u201cIf people cannot agree now, why would it be possible in three months?\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cThat being said, I don\u2019t see that [EU27] heads of state and government would say no [to a three-month extension]. Probably they will say \u2018let\u2019s do that, let\u2019s give them a last chance.\u2019\u201d During a three-month extension period the EU would accelerate the no-deal planning, the source added. European sources believe the last possible moment to clinch a Brexit deal, or an extension, will fall on 21/22 March, when EU leaders, including the prime minister, gather for a scheduled spring summit. \u201cThe absolute deadline is the European council,\u201d said another senior EU source, casting doubt on an 11th-hour agreement in the immediate days before 29 March, when the UK leaves the EU, with or without a deal. Intense discussion on delaying Brexit came as the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, arrived in Brussels on Tuesday for talks with the team of the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. \u201cThey held detailed technical discussions as part of the process ... to agree a deal that would have the support of the UK parliament and the EU,\u201d a UK spokesperson said. Cox was meeting EU officials in an attempt to pin down further assurances that would persuade MPs to back the Brexit deal they rejected by a historic majority last month. Work is being pursued in three areas. First, the two sides are exploring changes to the non-binding political declaration that maps out the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The new version is expected to feature more details on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protection, as May attempts to win over Labour MPs. But the government continues to rule out Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plan of a full customs union with the EU. The second strand of work is focused on agreeing a process to agree \u201calternative arrangements\u201d that could replace the contested Irish backstop. The backstop, a fallback plan to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, is part of the 585-page withdrawal agreement, which the EU has said is not open for renegotiation. The EU has, however, promised to explore with the UK \u201calternative arrangements\u201d such as technology and efficient customs procedures that could render the backstop unnecessary. Tory Eurosceptic backbenchers hoping for a speedy agreement on those alternative arrangements are likely to be disappointed. Instead, negotiators hope to agree on a detailed timetable on the process for finding those alternative arrangements for the next 21 months. The third area of work also seeks to quell MPs\u2019 fears about the UK being \u201ctrapped\u201d in the backstop. The EU is ready to add more legal weight to previous guarantees that the backstop is a last-resort option. A letter from EU leaders, Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, released in January, could be turned into \u201ca joint interpretative statement\u201d \u2013 a document with greater legal heft that would be published in the EU rulebook, the Official Journal.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May has promised MPs the chance to reject a no-deal Brexit and possibly delay the departure date, while repeatedly declining to say whether or not she and the government would support such moves. In a significant first concession that Brexit could take place after 29 March, following months of insistence the deadline could not be shifted, May sought to appease restive Conservative backbenchers, but prompted concern from pro-Brexit MPs. In a sign of the continued uncertainty, the cross-party backers of a plan to be debated by MPs on Wednesday intended to prevent no deal said they would still table the amendment, pending further assurances from ministers. Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister was yet again trying to run down the clock to pressure parliament into backing her deal, calling this \u201cgrotesquely reckless\u201d. Making a statement to the Commons after her talks with EU leaders in Egypt, May reiterated her pledge to give MPs a meaningful vote on a revised Brexit deal by 12 March. If this did not happen or if it was voted down, then by 13 March MPs would be able to vote on a motion that would seek their \u201cexplicit consent\u201d for a no-deal departure, the prime minister said. If MPs voted against this, then on 14 March a motion would be put to the Commons offering the option of a \u201cshort, limited extension to article 50\u201d beyond 29 March, which would need the approval of the EU. The concession on the departure date follows intense pressure from remain-minded Conservatives, with a number of ministers having pledged to resign if necessary to avert the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The resignations would have allowed them to support an amendment to the latest government Brexit motion seeking to stop no deal, led by Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper and Conservative MP Nick Boles. After a meeting between backers of the plan, Boles tweeted that the amendment would still be tabled, but that MPs would \u201cseek confirmation of her commitments from ministers\u201d. But another Tory MP who backed the plan, Oliver Letwin, tweeted that there was now \u201cno need\u201d for the proposal. Responding to questions after her statement, the prime minister repeatedly refused to answer questions on whether she and the government would support or oppose no deal or an extension to article 50 if the votes were held. May\u2019s spokesman also declined to be drawn, saying the prime minister\u2019s focus was \u201cto get a deal over the line in a way that the House of Commons can support it\u201d. He told reporters: \u201cQuestions on whipping on what may or may not follow that are for another day.\u201d Asked what length of extension the government would recommend if her deal failed and MPs rejected no deal, the spokesman pointed to the prime minister\u2019s words, saying it would be \u201cas short as possible\u201d, and declined to say what the government would do if MPs amended the motion to demand a longer period. Pressed on whether May was willing to take Britain out of the EU without a deal, he said: \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t give parliament a vote if she wasn\u2019t willing to abide by it.\u201d The concession angered Brexit-minded Conservative MPs from the European Research Group. Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky that if a delay was seen as a way to stop Brexit completely, this \u201cwould be the most grievous error that politicians could commit\u201d. Theresa Villers told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that the prime minister is partially backtracking on her repeated statements that we would leave on 29 March.\u201d May stressed her own continued aversion to this option, saying the \u201cabsolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on 29 March\u201d. Nonetheless, her concession brought expressions of relief from business groups, with the British Chambers of Commerce calling it \u201ca small step towards the clarity and precision that businesses need to chart their future direction\u201d. May sought to keep Conservative backbenchers on side by saying the UK and EU would devote time to alternative arrangements to avoid the Irish border backstop, a plan devised by several Tory MPs. Corbyn said Labour would still back the Cooper amendment, so as to \u201cto rule out that reckless cliff-edge Brexit\u201d. He also talked up a planned Labour amendment seeking the party\u2019s version of Brexit, including membership of a customs union. In a change to policy, on Monday it was announced that if this plan was not adopted, Labour would back a second Brexit referendum. May criticised this move, saying: \u201cAnyone who voted Labour at the last election because they thought he would deliver Brexit will rightly be appalled.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labour is braced for a backlash from shadow ministers and backbenchers angry at the party\u2019s plans to support an amendment for a second EU referendum, with several of them warning they would defy the whip in order to sink the plan. Jeremy Corbyn finally threw his party\u2019s weight behind another vote on Brexit on Monday evening, backing moves for a fresh referendum with remain on the ballot paper if Labour fails to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week. Labour sources suggested there was a vocal backlash against the decision at a shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, including against the fact it had not been discussed and agreed at a full meeting. The shadow cabinet did not meet last week, and the Brexit move was considered in a series of meetings and conversations among a smaller group of shadow ministers including Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Diane Abbott. Labour\u2019s chairman, Ian Lavery, and the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, have previously expressed scepticism about supporting a second referendum. \u201cI suspect we\u2019ll see a bit of back-pedalling today,\u201d one Labour MP said.

The high-profile backbenchers Stephen Kinnock, Lucy Powell and Caroline Flint are among the others who would be highly likely to oppose a second referendum amendment.

Thornberry told broadcasters earlier that those would be terms of a future referendum, and she later stood by her remarks, publicly criticising the Labour briefing. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some nonsense that I \u2018misspoke\u2019 earlier on a public vote,\u201d she said. \u201cPretty hard to misspeak identically in 10 interviews, but for clarity: if Theresa May won\u2019t accept our deal, then the public must decide: do we accept whatever deal she gets through, or do we remain? Got it?\u201d Watson also criticised the briefing. \u201cWhoever briefed that my colleague \u2018misspoke\u2019 undermines the sovereignty of the current shadow cabinet,\u201d he tweeted.",

Once praised by Pope Francis for his honesty and response to child sexual abuse, the Australian cardinal\u2019s reputation is in ruins after a jury in Melbourne found him guilty of five charges \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/who-is-george-pell-and-what-has-he-been-convicted-of\">one of sexually penetrating a child under</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/cardinal-george-pell-vatican-treasurer-found-guilty-of-child-sexual-assault\">16 </a>and four of an indecent act with a child under 16. The charges date back to 1996 and 1997, months after Pell was inaugurated as the city\u2019s archbishop. The jury found that he walked in on two 13-year-old choirboys after a Sunday mass and then manoeuvred his robes to expose his penis. Pell then forced one of the boys\u2019 heads on to his penis, orally raping him. Once he had finished, Pell ordered the complainant to remove his pants, before fondling the complainant\u2019s penis and masturbating himself.</p> \n<p>The verdict was delivered in December but was subject to a suppression order because of a possible second trial, over different allegations, now dropped. Dozens of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/26/dozens-of-journalists-accused-of-breaking-pell-trial-suppression-order-face-possible-jail-terms\">journalists and news outlets</a> who alluded to the verdict at the time it was delivered face prosecutions and possible jail terms for contempt of court. It was the second time in the space of a few months that Pell had been tried for the crimes; in August he had faced a jury who were unable to reach a verdict.</p> \n<p>You can read the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/26/five-times-guilty-how-george-pells-child-abusing-past-caught-up-with-him-in-courtroom-43\">inside account of the two trials here</a>, by the Guardian\u2019s Melissa Davey, who sat through every day of evidence.

It follows a concerted push by Keir Starmer and Tom Watson, who fear any further delay may have led to more defections to the Independent Group. A private briefing sent to Labour MPs last night and seen by the Guardian makes it clear that Labour\u2019s policy would be to include remain as an option in any future referendum.

The PM\u2019s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit for a short time if she does renegotiate her withdrawal deal and win support for it before 12 March. Three other ministers have urged May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Writing in the Daily Mail, Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said the government should extend article 50 to avoid leaving with no agreement on 29 March.</p> \n<p>In other Brexit news, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/26/britons-face-five-hour-airport-queues-in-spain-with-no-deal-brexit\">Britons could face five-hour airport queues in Spain</a> in the event of no deal, with Alicante airport likely to be worst affected, according to Which?</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Kashmir crisis</strong> \u2013 India <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/26/pakistan-india-jets-breached-ceasefire-line-kashmir-bomb\">has launched airstrikes</a> on what it calls \u201cterror camps\u201d across the ceasefire line in disputed Kashmir. Pakistan said there was no damage or casualties in the first aerial bombing over the border since the two countries went to war in 1971. The operation comes amid the highest tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/15/indian-pm-modi-pakistan-pay-heavy-price-kashmir-bombing\">after a suicide attack on a convoy carrying 2,500 Indian security personnel killed at least 40 earlier this month.</a> India says its neighbour had a \u201cdirect hand\u201d in the attack. Pakistan denies any involvement.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Depression </strong>\u2013 Women working more than 55 hours a week are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/25/women-working-longer-hours-more-likely-to-be-depressed-study\">more likely to suffer </a>than those who work 35-40 hours, a study has found. In contrast, men who put in the same hours are no more likely to exhibit signs of depression. Researchers who carried out the study, based on 20,000 British adults, suggests this could be because women face a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of very long hours spent in their job on top of domestic chores, which they tend to do much more of than male partners. Women are also likelier than men to display signs of debilitating low moods linked to working on Saturday and Sunday (4.6% and 3.4% more likely).</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Unwanted sexual behaviour </strong>\u2013 More than half of students at UK universities say they are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/26/more-than-half-of-uk-students-say-they-have-faced-unwanted-sexual-behaviour\">victims of unwanted advances and assault</a>, but only a fraction reported the incidents. The behaviour ranged from explicit messages to rape, new research for the charity Brook and the student database Dig-In shows. A survey of 5,649 students found many admitted a lack of understanding of what legally constitutes sexual harassment and violence. The study, conducted in January, showed 53% of respondents said they had encountered unwelcome sexual behaviour.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Sleep like a baby? </strong>\u2013 Starting a family is a well-known sleep killer, but new research suggests the exhaustion might go on for six years. Researchers at the University of Warwick tracking the sleep of thousands of men and women found sleep <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/26/parenthood-sleep-deprivation-after-birth-mothers-hit-hardest-research\">hits a low about three months after birth </a>\u2013 with the effect strongest in women. The team found the impact of the first child lingered for both parents. Even once the impact of subsequent children was taken into account, women were still relatively sleep deprived, both in terms of quality and quantity, four to six years after their first child\u2019s birth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"098dcce9e41da18957a330e7dc499a4f69966293\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/098dcce9e41da18957a330e7dc499a4f69966293/0_0_5123_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The study found mothers lost about 40 minutes of sleep a night in the year after the birth of a child.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The study found mothers lost about 40 minutes of sleep a night in the year after the birth of a child.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images/Blend Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>More warm weather </strong>\u2013 The Met Office says today\u2019s temperatures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/26/uk-weather-tuesday-may-eclipse-mondays-record-temperatures\">could rival Monday\u2019s record-breaking highs</a>, where three places in the UK pushed the mercury over 20C. \u201cWe could well again see similar values,\u201d the Met\u2019s Luke Miall said. \u201cWhether it will be record-breaking again, we\u2019re not quite sure, but I think it could be quite close.\u201d The day is likely to start with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rise to highs of about 19 or 20C.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Pell\u2019s bombshell conviction a blow for the pope This is Alison Rourke bringing you today\u2019s briefing. The conviction and likely imprisonment of Cardinal George Pell, the third most senior Catholic in the world and the Vatican\u2019s treasurer, will send shockwaves through the church\u2019s global congregation. Once praised by Pope Francis for his honesty and response to child sexual abuse, the Australian cardinal\u2019s reputation is in ruins after a jury in Melbourne found him guilty of five charges \u2013 one of sexually penetrating a child under 16 and four of an indecent act with a child under 16. The charges date back to 1996 and 1997, months after Pell was inaugurated as the city\u2019s archbishop. The jury found that he walked in on two 13-year-old choirboys after a Sunday mass and then manoeuvred his robes to expose his penis. Pell then forced one of the boys\u2019 heads on to his penis, orally raping him. Once he had finished, Pell ordered the complainant to remove his pants, before fondling the complainant\u2019s penis and masturbating himself. The verdict was delivered in December but was subject to a suppression order because of a possible second trial, over different allegations, now dropped. Dozens of journalists and news outlets who alluded to the verdict at the time it was delivered face prosecutions and possible jail terms for contempt of court. It was the second time in the space of a few months that Pell had been tried for the crimes; in August he had faced a jury who were unable to reach a verdict. You can read the inside account of the two trials here, by the Guardian\u2019s Melissa Davey, who sat through every day of evidence. You can read David Marr\u2019s account of how the \u201cbrutal and dogmatic\u201d Pell waged war on sex \u2013 even as he abused children. And you can read the Guardian\u2019s religion correspondent Harriet Sherwood\u2019s take on the implications of Pell\u2019s conviction for the pope\u2019s push to rid the Catholic church of child abuse. * * * Corbyn\u2019s change\u2013 The Labour party leader has finally put his weight behind a second Brexit referendum, backing moves for a fresh poll with remain on the ballot paper if the party fails to get its own version of a Brexit deal passed this week. It follows a concerted push by Keir Starmer and Tom Watson, who fear any further delay may have led to more defections to the Independent Group. A private briefing sent to Labour MPs last night and seen by the Guardian makes it clear that Labour\u2019s policy would be to include remain as an option in any future referendum. You can read about the implications for Labour of Corbyn\u2019s move here. Meanwhile, Theresa May is expected to make a last-ditch attempt to avoid a cabinet rebellion this morning, before a vote on Wednesday on a cross-party amendment laid by the Tory Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper that would in effect rule out a no-deal scenario. The PM\u2019s most likely option is a pledge to let MPs vote on delaying Brexit for a short time if she does renegotiate her withdrawal deal and win support for it before 12 March. Three other ministers have urged May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. Writing in the Daily Mail, Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said the government should extend article 50 to avoid leaving with no agreement on 29 March. In other Brexit news, Britons could face five-hour airport queues in Spain in the event of no deal, with Alicante airport likely to be worst affected, according to Which? * * * Kashmir crisis \u2013 India has launched airstrikes on what it calls \u201cterror camps\u201d across the ceasefire line in disputed Kashmir. Pakistan said there was no damage or casualties in the first aerial bombing over the border since the two countries went to war in 1971. The operation comes amid the highest tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in years, after a suicide attack on a convoy carrying 2,500 Indian security personnel killed at least 40 earlier this month. India says its neighbour had a \u201cdirect hand\u201d in the attack. Pakistan denies any involvement. * * * Depression \u2013 Women working more than 55 hours a week are more likely to suffer than those who work 35-40 hours, a study has found. In contrast, men who put in the same hours are no more likely to exhibit signs of depression. Researchers who carried out the study, based on 20,000 British adults, suggests this could be because women face a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of very long hours spent in their job on top of domestic chores, which they tend to do much more of than male partners. Women are also likelier than men to display signs of debilitating low moods linked to working on Saturday and Sunday (4.6% and 3.4% more likely). * * * Unwanted sexual behaviour \u2013 More than half of students at UK universities say they are victims of unwanted advances and assault, but only a fraction reported the incidents. The behaviour ranged from explicit messages to rape, new research for the charity Brook and the student database Dig-In shows. A survey of 5,649 students found many admitted a lack of understanding of what legally constitutes sexual harassment and violence. The study, conducted in January, showed 53% of respondents said they had encountered unwelcome sexual behaviour. * * * Sleep like a baby? \u2013 Starting a family is a well-known sleep killer, but new research suggests the exhaustion might go on for six years. Researchers at the University of Warwick tracking the sleep of thousands of men and women found sleep hits a low about three months after birth \u2013 with the effect strongest in women. The team found the impact of the first child lingered for both parents. Even once the impact of subsequent children was taken into account, women were still relatively sleep deprived, both in terms of quality and quantity, four to six years after their first child\u2019s birth. * * * More warm weather \u2013 The Met Office says today\u2019s temperatures could rival Monday\u2019s record-breaking highs, where three places in the UK pushed the mercury over 20C. \u201cWe could well again see similar values,\u201d the Met\u2019s Luke Miall said. \u201cWhether it will be record-breaking again, we\u2019re not quite sure, but I think it could be quite close.\u201d The day is likely to start with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rise to highs of about 19 or 20C. North-west Wales and London are most likely to feel the highest temperatures. Today in Focus podcast: The fit-for-work scandal After a picture of 64-year-old Stephen Smith\u2019s emaciated frame went viral, the Department for Work and Pensions apologised for passing him fit to work. It was the latest example of how reforms to disability benefits are hitting some of Britain\u2019s most disadvantaged people. The Guardian\u2019s Patrick Butler explains how we got here. Plus: Polly Toynbee welcomes Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s move towards backing a new Brexit referendum. Lunchtime read: Five stars for This time with Alan Partridge Alan Partridge\u2019s return to TV is an excruciating white-knuckle ride, writes Lucy Mangan. After half an hour in his appalling company, you\u2019ll be limp from laughter, loathing, panic and despair. It\u2019s the character\u2019s first proper run-out since his 2013 feature film Alpha Papa, and is co-written and directed by twin brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who have become not just keepers of the flame but fuel and bellows for it too. This Time brings Alan back, in all his glory and his tragedy, at just the right time. He surely voted Leave but, as a man of no convictions or courage, must now want to remain. We get the heroes we deserve, and as you finish writhing in agony, you can only reflect that if Brexit means Alan then the whole business just got more complicated still. Sport Evidence supplied by Dario Gradi related to the Barry Bennell scandal can be revealed by the Guardian and includes an admission that he encouraged the culture at Crewe Alexandra for coaches to invite boys to stay overnight, or even take them on holidays abroad. David Luiz has delivered a public show of support for Maurizio Sarri and insisted Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s refusal to be substituted late in the Carabao Cup final was not indicative of a lack of respect within the Chelsea squad for their beleaguered head coach. Jarrell \u201cBig Baby\u201d Miller has claimed, with no evidence, that the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua has used performance-enhancing drugs. England Women fell to a seven-wicket defeat against India in the second one-day international in Mumbai as the hosts secured victory in the series, while the men\u2019s third ODI against West Indies in Grenada was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain. Maro Itoje has not been deemed fit enough to take a full part in England\u2019s Six Nations training camp in Oxford this week and Charlie Ewels has been called up in place of the injured Courtney Lawes. The plane that crashed in the Channel carrying the Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala fell thousands of feet in the space of 20 seconds after making a 180-degree turn. And the Guardian won two awards and was highly commended in four other categories at the Sports Journalists\u2019 Association awards; Donald McRae was named sports feature writer of the year while Daniel Taylor was named football writer of the year. Business Asian shares lost steam on Tuesday after scaling a five-month high as investors waited to see if Washington and Beijing could clinch a trade deal. Meanwhile, sterling jumped to a near four-week high ($1.3149) in early Asian trading after Bloomberg reported Theresa May could allow her cabinet to discuss extending the Brexit deadline beyond 29 March at a meeting later today. The pound is buying $1.31 and \u20ac1.16.
