With only one run in his pocket, an over-eager Nick Browne failed to make his ground after being sent back by Alastair Cook. But one for one was as good as it got for Nottinghamshire as Cook and Tom Westley tickled the runs away. Nottinghamshire have now played 10 successive championship matches without a win; their coach, Peter Moores, was keen to \u201cmove on quickly\u201d.</p> <p>A thriller was developing at Taunton after <strong>Somerset</strong> edged an 18 run first-innings lead over <strong>Surrey</strong> thanks to 129 not out from Lewis Gregory. Surrey stuttered in reply, with Rory Burns\u2019 clothes-peg innings of 78 ending just before the close. Surrey \u2013 152 for five \u2013 lead by 134.</p> <p>Gary Ballance knocked out 159 \u2013 his third hundred in as many games \u2013 as <strong>Yorkshire</strong> made the most of a heavily rollered Canterbury pitch. <strong>Kent</strong>\u2019s unlikely chase of 384 tumbled into a damp ditch as Ben Coad whipped out danger man Zak Crawley and Kent finished on 34 for three.</p> <p>Dom Sibley had an up and down day as <strong>Hampshire</strong> turned the screw against <strong>Warwickshire</strong>. Sibley carried his bat for 109 in the first innings \u2013 his sixth first-class century in as many matches \u2013 but was out for three in the second as Warwickshire chased an implausible 424 to win. In between, Hampshire sped to 302 for five declared.</p> <p>In Division Two it was a glorious day for <strong>Glamorgan</strong> who, asked to follow on, finished at 359 for one \u2013 a lead of 146 over <strong>Gloucestershire</strong>. Nick Selman made a career-best 148 not out, and Marnus Labuschagne, who knocked two sixes into the football ground, 128 not out.</p> <p><strong>Lancashire</strong> were a sneeze \u2013 and 16 runs \u2013 away from victory after taking the extra half-hour at Old Trafford. <strong>Northamptonshire</strong> stumbled to 200 all out thanks to five for 50 from Richard Gleeson, his first championship ten-wicket haul. Earlier Lancashire made 415, with a career best 68 from Tom Bailey and 97 from Dane Vilas \u2013 the fifth Lancashire batsman to be out in the 90s this season.</p> <p><strong>Worcestershire</strong> want only 81 to win at New Road after bowling <strong>Durham</strong> out for 197, Josh Tongue collected five for 37.</p> <p>And at Lord\u2019s, <strong>Leicestershire</strong> were 38-0 chasing 305 to win after earlier bowling <strong>Middlesex</strong> out for 223 \u2013 a surprise recovery from 114 for eight thanks to an unbeaten 59 from John Simpson. There were three wickets apiece for the tireless Tom Taylor and Chris Wright.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cddaba38f088c3e913d7b2b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-16T18:37:45.489Z\">7.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s been all go here at Old Trafford,</strong> with Lancashire only a quick scratch from victory over Northants - thanks to five wickets from Richard Gleeson and a couple each from Livingstone and Bailey.

      "bodyText": "Essex won their first championship game of the season, beating big-spenders Nottinghamshire by eight wickets on a capricious Chelmsford pitch. Set 105 to win after Simon Harmer had taken two early-morning wickets to add to the previous night\u2019s haul (finishing with six for 60 plus a snaffled catch), Essex got off to a bad start. With only one run in his pocket, an over-eager Nick Browne failed to make his ground after being sent back by Alastair Cook. But one for one was as good as it got for Nottinghamshire as Cook and Tom Westley tickled the runs away. Nottinghamshire have now played 10 successive championship matches without a win; their coach, Peter Moores, was keen to \u201cmove on quickly\u201d. A thriller was developing at Taunton after Somerset edged an 18 run first-innings lead over Surrey thanks to 129 not out from Lewis Gregory. Surrey stuttered in reply, with Rory Burns\u2019 clothes-peg innings of 78 ending just before the close. Surrey \u2013 152 for five \u2013 lead by 134. Gary Ballance knocked out 159 \u2013 his third hundred in as many games \u2013 as Yorkshire made the most of a heavily rollered Canterbury pitch. Kent\u2019s unlikely chase of 384 tumbled into a damp ditch as Ben Coad whipped out danger man Zak Crawley and Kent finished on 34 for three. Dom Sibley had an up and down day as Hampshire turned the screw against Warwickshire. Sibley carried his bat for 109 in the first innings \u2013 his sixth first-class century in as many matches \u2013 but was out for three in the second as Warwickshire chased an implausible 424 to win. In between, Hampshire sped to 302 for five declared. In Division Two it was a glorious day for Glamorgan who, asked to follow on, finished at 359 for one \u2013 a lead of 146 over Gloucestershire. Nick Selman made a career-best 148 not out, and Marnus Labuschagne, who knocked two sixes into the football ground, 128 not out. Lancashire were a sneeze \u2013 and 16 runs \u2013 away from victory after taking the extra half-hour at Old Trafford. Northamptonshire stumbled to 200 all out thanks to five for 50 from Richard Gleeson, his first championship ten-wicket haul. Earlier Lancashire made 415, with a career best 68 from Tom Bailey and 97 from Dane Vilas \u2013 the fifth Lancashire batsman to be out in the 90s this season. Worcestershire want only 81 to win at New Road after bowling Durham out for 197, Josh Tongue collected five for 37. And at Lord\u2019s, Leicestershire were 38-0 chasing 305 to win after earlier bowling Middlesex out for 223 \u2013 a surprise recovery from 114 for eight thanks to an unbeaten 59 from John Simpson. There were three wickets apiece for the tireless Tom Taylor and Chris Wright. It\u2019s been all go here at Old Trafford, with Lancashire only a quick scratch from victory over Northants - thanks to five wickets from Richard Gleeson and a couple each from Livingstone and Bailey. Elsewhere, Glamorgan have gone all Dallas (359/1) and Warwickshire, Kent and Durham are in deep trouble. Worth keeping half an eye on Lord\u2019s in the morning, but set the webcam for Taunton - should be a cracker. That\u2019s it from me, thanks as always, \u00e0 demain. I\u2019d better pause to write up, but keep an eye on things at Taunton and Newport for me. Patterson goes for a duck, b Clayton, but Yorkshire -417/8 - have built up a stonking lead of 331 on Kent. Surrey safely gathering up their skirts at Taunton, Foakes and Burns keeping Leach hungry -84/3 lead of 66. The Bears\u2019 chase doesn\u2019t start well. Dom Sibley gone for 3, that man Abbott again. Warwicks 3-1, needing another 421 to win. Simpson and Helm taking the game away from Leicester at Lord\u2019s. Partnership of 71 for the 9th wicket. Middx lead now 266. Burnham gone for 26, three for Josh Tongue and Durham 133/6 lead Worcestershire by 16. And Hampshire have declared! At 302/5: Rossouw 76, Donald 16 not out (1 six). Warwickshire need a handy 424 to win. Dom Sibley dreaming of joining Tyldesley &amp; Bradman in the pantheon. My computer has entered one of its geriatric phases so I can\u2019t actually watch this - but here is Leach\u2019s wicket: At Taunton, Dean Elgar won\u2019t bat today because of illness and just clocked that before tea Jack Leach bowled Ryan Patel for 12. Surrey 49/3. Rubbing hands together vigorously. Different session, same outcome. Bavuma edges the first ball after tea through to Vilas off Bailey and Northants are 87-4, still trailing by 98. Bavuma looks most out of sorts about the decision. TEA-TIME SCORES Division One Essex v Nottinghamshire: Essex 241 (Browne 67; Fletcher 5-50) and 105/2 (Westley 49, Cook 40 not out); Nottinghamshire 187 (Porter 4-75) and 158 (Harmer 6-60, Porter 3-41) ESSEX WIN BY 8 WICKETS. Warwickshire v Hampshire: Hampshire 354 (Alsop 140, Donald 75; Patel 6-94, Hannon-Dalby 4-69) and 225-3 (Soames 62, Rossouw 54 not out); Warwickshire 233 (Sibley 109 not out; Abbot 4-50) Somerset v Surrey: Surrey 380 (Burns 107, Elgar 103, Clarke 59 not out; Gregory 3-52; Leach 3-85) and 49-3 ; Somerset 398(Azhar 60, Hildreth 90,Gregory 129 not out; McKerr 3-94, Clarke 3-74) Kent v Yorkshire: Yorkshire 210 (Milnes 3-63) and 370-5 (Ballance 159, Leaning 69); Kent 296 all out (Crawley 81, Robinson 103; Coad 3-66, Olivier 3-82) Essex v Nottinghamshire: Essex 241 (Browne 67; Fletcher 5-50) and 18-1; Nottinghamshire 187 (Porter 4-75) and 158 (Harmer 6-60, Porter 3-41) Essex need 87 to win. Division Two Worcestershire v Durham: Durham 273 (Burnham 76, Bancroft 70; Morris 6-53; Leach 3-59) and 110-5 (Tongue 2-17); Worcestershire 390 (Dell 61, Wessels 118, Whitely 72; Salisbury 4-67) Middlesex v Leicestershire: Middlesex 349 (Gubbins 75; Abbas 4-72) and 166-8 (Tom Taylor 3-56, Chris Wright 3-29) ; Leicestershire 268 (Ackermann 63; Rayner 4-58) Lancashire v Northants: Northants 230 (Luke Wood 66; Gleeson 5-63, Onions 4-45) and 87-3 ; Lancashire 415 (Jennings 97; Jones 67, Vilas 97; BAiley 68; Luke Wood 5-72 ) Glamorgan v Gloucestershire: Gloucestershire 463 (Bracey 152, Roderick 88, Higgins 103 de Lange 4-116); Glamorgan 250-9 (Hemphrey 60, Wagg 50; Drissell 4-83) and 195-1 (Selman 83 not out) It is tea at Newport so I can safely say nice work to Nick Selman (83 not out) and Marnus Labuschagne (43 not out) for steering the good ship Glamorgan to calmer waters. 195/1, trailing Gloucestershire by just 9. Thanks to Dave Karaoke for alerting me to this super stumping of Gareth Harte by Ben Cox. Durham fans, look away now (you\u2019re 105 for 4 btw, trailing by 12) Hampshire top-order cameos looking like they\u2019ll be more than enough at Edgbaston - 209 for 3, a lead of 331 over Warwickshire. Another Northants batsman bites the dust: Procter edges Onions to Jennings at slip for 15 - Northants 54/3. And Gary Ballance 153 not out at Canterbury, time for a photo of England\u2019s discarded. Wakely examines the toe of his bat after picking out Haseeb Hameed at cover off Richard Gleeson\u2019s first over. Northants 54/2, trail by 131. Essex have won by eight wickets - Cook 40 not out, Westley 49. Notts have now played three, won 0, lost 2. Big-spenders looking in their pockets for spare change. Tom Taylor in the wickets again at Lord\u2019s - 3-34 as Middlesex, how can I put this politely? - anyway, they\u2019re 114/8. And Surrey lose another, this is turning most interesting at Taunton. Surrey 24/2, Borthwick lbw Craig Overton for 15. In other news, Essex are nearly there - 13 to win, 8 wickets in hand. At Taunton, Somerset got a lead of 8, Stoneman already out in Surrey\u2019s second innings, 19/1. And here at OT, Vasconcelos gives Stephen Croft easy catching practise, out for 22. Northants 34/1. Just spent a lovely twenty minutes sitting in the sun watching Bailey and Mahmood bowl from side-on while listening to a monologue on Manchester buses and David Cameron\u2019s triple lock. The odd tram joined in rumbling agreement. So: Saqib Mahmood looks a very well put together bowler, two arms, two legs, both well-screwed into their correct joints, working in unison over a smooth, accelerating 13-step approach to the crease. Lovely to watch. How fast? Honestly, I struggle with estimates (asks desperately, \u201ccan I blame my astigmatism\u201d ).Not 90s, but enough to have Vasconcelos prodding about. Bailey, by contrast, is a high-kneed, shaggy blond-haired effort bowler. Lancashire 415 all out. Gleeson lbw Keogh for 0, Mahmood high and dry on 27. Luke Wood 5-72. Time for a very quick stretch of the legs. Lancashire\u2019s innings death-rattles away -Graham Onins gone for 8, 414-9. More than enough in the bank. Gary Naylor is at Lord\u2019s where, he says, the boundary on the Grandstand side has been brought in 30 yards \u201c but still afforded an all-run four for Sam Robson. With the pitch so far to the Tavern side, were they using the ground\u2019s fullest dimensions, they might get seven to Third Man.\u201d He also nominates this for catch of the season.

Hundred data-glitch - no such variable. Glamorgan sail past 100 with all wickets intact! Durham lose their first wicket after lunch - Alex Lees lbw for 2. And as I type the BBC updates, Ceefax style, Cameron Steel bowled Leach for 17. Durham, 20/2, still trail Worcestershire by 97 and enter a dead-end race with Notts for first defeat of the round. Vilas, Vilas, tips the ball back to Wood and is easily caught- the second 97 of the match and the fifth Lancashire batsman to be out in the nineties this season. Lancs 400/8. A Lewis Gregory century! Well played -121 balls, 8 fours, 2 sixes, he\u2019s taken Somerset within 19 of Surrey\u2019s total. I give you, man hugs. LUNCH-TIME SCORES Division One Warwickshire v Hampshire: Hampshire 354 (Alsop 140, Donald 75; Patel 6-94, Hannon-Dalby 4-69) and 50-0; Warwickshire 233 (Sibley 109 not out; Abbot 4-50) Somerset v Surrey: Surrey 380 (Burns 107, Elgar 103, Clarke 59 not out; Gregory 3-52; Leach 3-85); Somerset 353-7 (Azhar 60, Hildreth 90,Gregory 96 not out; McKerr 3-94) Kent v Yorkshire: Yorkshire 210 (Milnes 3-63) and 261-3 (Ballance 103 not out); Kent 296 all out (Crawley 81, Robinson 103; Coad 3-66, Olivier 3-82) Essex v Nottinghamshire: Essex 241 (Browne 67; Fletcher 5-50) and 18-1; Nottinghamshire 187 (Porter 4-75) and 158 (Harmer 6-60, Porter 3-41) Essex need 87 to win. Division Two Worcestershire v Durham: Durham 273 (Burnham 76, Bancroft 70; Morris 6-53; Leach 3-59) and 14-0; Worcestershire 390 (Dell 61, Wessels 118, Whitely 72; Salisbury 4-67) Middlesex v Leicestershire: Middlesex 349 (Gubbins 75; Abbas 4-72) and 73-3 ; Leicestershire 268 (Ackermann 63; Rayner 4-58) Lancashire v Northants: Northants 230 all out (Luke Wood 66; Gleeson 5-63, Onions 4-45); Lancashire 387-7(Jennings 97; Jones 67, Vilas 86 not out) Glamorgan v Gloucestershire: Gloucestershire 463 (Bracey 152, Roderick 88, Higgins 103 de Lange 4-116); Glamorgan 250-9 (Hemphrey 60, Wagg 50; Drissell 4-83) and 80-0 (Selman 45) That\u2019s lunch , Dane Vilas 86, Lancashire 387-7 and well on top. Scores on the door to follow. Not strictly cricket, but this just popped up on twitter. And thanks to AIEx BTL for writing beautifully about Bob Hawke who died peacefully at home last night, aged 89. RIP Bob, hope you\u2019ve picked up your bat at the great cricket ground in the sky. Here\u2019s the Guardian piece https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/16/bob-hawke-former-australian-prime-minister-dies-age-89 And at Newport, Glamorgan are flying. Nick Selman and Charlie Hemphrey showing that yesterday\u2019s collapse was just blossom in the wind. 63/0. Gregory passes his highest first-class score at Taunton, 78 not out, Somerset just 45 runs behind. And Middlesex 57 -3 in their second innings - Holden, Robson and Lace already unfolding their napkins for the Lord\u2019s lunch. Tom Taylor 2-22. Essex, read the briefing. Do not go for silly runs when chasing small totals. Essex 5/1, Browne run out 1. Thee Yorkies grind away, Gary Ballance on 88, Jack Leaning on 32. A lead over Kent of 144 with 7 wickets remaining. And Dom Sibley left high at dry at Edgbaston, Warwickshire 233 all out - a deficit of 101. And Notts all out for 158 - Stuart Broad the last man to go, bowled Porter for 9. Harmer 6-60, Porter 3-41. Essex need 104 to win. Oooooh, Somerset creeping, creeping towards Surrey\u2019s total, now just 62 behind. Lewis Gregory 65 not out. At Chelmsford, Moores has been stumped off Harmer, Fletcher caught by Harmer, and Notts have a lead of 103 with one wicket left. And Bailey plays down the wrong line, bang, farewell off stump. Eleven fours in his 68. Lancashire batsmen without a care in the world here at OT, current partnership of 122 between Vilas (50) and Bailey whose 68 is a career best. Overton, sadly, has been unthreatening this morning. Lancs 331-6, a lead of 101 over Northants. What does Simon Harmer eat for breakfast? Grannottinghamola. Nash gone for 32, Harmer 5-46, Notts 124/7. And, thanks for the info BTL, Dom Sibley\u2019s century was his sixth in successive matches (one for MCC, five for Warwicks). The last man to score five in succession for Warwicks? Brian Lara. Succour for Glamorgan fans: A lunchtime read: Actually, that\u2019s the end of Glamorgan\u2019s innings, with Chris Cooke retired hurt. A deficit of errr, 213 runs. Leicestershire also all out for 268, trailing Middlesex by 81. And that\u2019s a fourth first-class fifty for Tom Bailey here at Old Trafford and another, ANOTHER, hundred for \u201cIm your one and only DOMinator\u201d Sibley at Edgbaston. After his wonderful September 2018, could he be creeping into international contention? Stand up, get a drink, come back, four wickets have fallen: Brookes for 12 at Edgbaston _ Dom Sibley still there on 99!!! Davies, damn, for 58 at Taunton, a second for Batty. Whitely for 72 at New Road and... Wagg for 50 at Newport. Oh Glamorgan. Virat Kohli and pimple wash: Also, I learnt yesterday that there were 450,000!!! ticket requests for June\u2019s India v Pakistan World Cup game at Old Trafford - the most over-subscribed sports event in the UK since the 2012 Olympics. When does Taunton turn to Ciderabad? July? This looks like a good read from Melinda Farrell on Eoin Morgan May - can you beat it? Jasmine, peonies, swallows, swifts, asparagus and cricket full of hopes and good intentions. The sun is beating down here in Manchester and, by the looks of it, all round the country. I\u2019m feeling very smug as the final load of bed sheets are on the line, but not as smug as Essex who had Notts in deep dudgeon last night. Can\u2019t see them getting out of this one. A huge pat on the bat for Simon Harmer, who first made invaluable runs at No.8 alongside Peter Siddle and then, as Notts lost six for 16 runs in 11 overs, took 4 for 3 in 21 balls Warwickshire, Leicester and Glamorgan are also in a spot of bother but there are intriguing battles at Taunton and Canterbury and games on a knife edge at Old Trafford and New Road. Oh and this final link is for Selv, Middlesex president this year",

The advent of Vox, which won 24 seats in congress last month, pushed both the PP and the centre-right Citizens party further to the right as the three parties competed for voters.</p> \n<p>But the move backfired \u2013 particularly for the PP. After his strategy of cosying up to Vox failed to pay off, the PP\u2019s leader, Pablo Casado, is trying to reclaim the centre-ground and has begun denouncing the party as a far-right outfit.</p> \n<p>Citizens, meanwhile, is doing its best to stake its claim to that centre-ground and to portray itself as the true party of opposition.</p> \n<p>Vox is also recalibrating its approach.

Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s intended target was the LGBT community. Awkwardly for Kaczy\u0144ski, it is the Catholic church, a great ally to the PiS, which has been accused of being a far greater threat to children than the gay community.</p> \n<p>Since it came to power in 2015, PiS has sought to rally its conservative base with sound and fury about attempts to introduce more liberal sexual education in Warsaw and other cities run by the opposition.</p> \n<p>It seized on statements by the likes of Pawe\u0142 Rabiej, vice-president of Warsaw, who does not hide the fact that he is gay, who has said he is in favour of the legalisation of gay marriage and gay adoption in Poland.

Almost 8 million people have seen it.</p> \n<p>The ruling party appear to be floundering, dismissing the paedophile-priests as isolated cases while at the same time raising penalties for paedophilia to up to 30 years in prison.</p> \n<p>The opposition promised a new commission to investigate paedophilia in the Polish church.</p> \n<p>All of this is a prelude to national elections in the autumn.

But as they enter the polling booth they will have very different issues on their mind, as this survey of the six biggest countries conducted by the Europa group of newspapers reveals. France \u2013 We are all protectionists now It used to be a dirty word in an open country that is part of the world\u2019s biggest single market. But French parties are increasingly adopting the p-word in this campaign, even if they don\u2019t always say it out loud. On the far left, La France Insoumise supports \u201csolidarity protectionism\u201d and proposes the idea of a \u201ckilometric carbon tax\u201d: the further the product is shipped, the more it is taxed. The green fringe advocate something similar \u2013 a carbon tax at the border of the EU and restrictions on imports from countries that do not permit free union association. Meanwhile, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally advocates an \u201cintelligent protectionism\u201d that would support the national economy through the restoration of customs duties. The socialists too are revising their position on protectionism, a result of years of social dumping and market disruption. \u201cWe assume a form of protectionism and put trade policy at the service of ecology and the fight against inequality,\u201d says Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, leader of the influential Place Publique movement, who heads a common list with the PS. Even Emmanuel Macron\u2019s movement seems to be converted. Admittedly, the term \u201cprotectionism\u201d is not used in the program of the presidential party. But \u201cprotection\u201d is, with those of \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d, the key words of the head of list Nathalie Loiseau. And the campaign slogan is: \u201cA Europe that protects.\u201d Like the Macronists, the Republican party (LR) is reluctant to use the word \u201cprotectionism\u201d. But their draft program defends customs protection, and recommends putting in place, in the face of foreign products, \u201ca double preference, European and French, on the model of the \u2018Buy American Act\u2019 by assuming to give priority to our companies and our jobs\u201d. LR wants to reserve 50% of public contracts for local companies. If this idea, initially borne by the opponents of free trade, eventually became practically consensual, it is because the European construction is perceived as the establishment of a large market that would ultimately promote social insecurity, economic and ecological. \u201cProtectionism has been constantly associated since the 19th century with the idea of increasing customs duties to protect oneself,\u201d says Olivier Dard, professor of contemporary history at the Sorbonne. \u201cBut is this really protectionism that we are looking at today, or a broader idea of protection that goes way beyond simply ideas of tariffs?\u201d Alexandre Lemari\u00e9, of Le Monde Italy \u2013 The north-south divide \u201cWe pay too many taxes,\u201d laments Klodian Qoshja, manager of a leather processing company near the northern city of Vicenza. \u201cHere you have to work 16 hours a day to get an entrepreneur salary.\u201d Tax is a dirty word in Italy\u2019s industrial north, which far outperforms the south in the wealth it generates. Northern provinces are determined to secure greater fiscal autonomy, but even though their great champion, the (formerly Northern) League party is now in government in Rome, their appeals have had little effect. \u201cAutonomy will be achieved,\u201d Salvini continues to repeat at his speeches, although his coalition partner, the Five Star Movement, are less enthusiastic. Thus far the League has not suffered for not delivering on one of its core objectives. In this part of Italy, support for the League runs at more than 40%, dipping to about 30% nationwide \u2013 still ahead of the other European election hopefuls. \u201cThe current picture plays in the League\u2019s favour because the topic is much discussed in the regions where autonomy is demanded, while there is a cloak of silence over the other regions,\u201d says Gianfranco Viesti, professor of applied economics at the University of Bari. \u201cVotes can be maintained by promising autonomy in one part of Italy, but you can avoid losing them in other parts of Italy by not talking about it,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is a party that speaks two different languages in two areas of the country.\u201d The village where Qoshja has his factory, San Pietro Mussolino, witnessed the highest turnout at a referendum on regional autonomy in 2017, and almost all voters voted in favour. \u201cWe have always had the speech of autonomy in our blood, even before they talked about it,\u201d says Graziano Rancan, a bar owner. \u201cWe have paid so many contributions, now we continue to pay contributions but there is not enough money left to develop what we have lacked\u201d. Paolo Negro Marcigaglia, who runs an organic food company just one block from Qoshja\u2019s leather factory, sees no other options: \u201cWe make an appeal to (League leader Matteo) Salvini to keep this promise that the League has been making for decades now.\u201d \u201cI feel a bit like a worker in a company,\u201d says Marcigaglia, making a metaphor about the state and taxes. \u201cA company in which the owner every year takes away his dividends without investing anything.\u201d Cecilia Butini of La Stampa UK \u2013 The paradox of Brexit Once it became clear that Britons would have to vote in the 2019 elections, despite having voted to leave Europe almost three years ago, the campaign very quickly became a mirror of the 2016 referendum, a microcosm of the exhausting battle for Brexit. As the party overseeing the debacle which has seen the UK stumble through almost three years without a departure plan anyone can agree on, Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives are expected to receive a solid kicking, with even many party activists saying they will vote for other parties. At the last elections in 2014, when the Eurosceptic mood was also strong, the Conservatives won only 24% of the vote. Polling for this month\u2019s equivalent has them on as little a 13%. They could easily place fourth \u2013 or worse. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party is polling marginally better, but at little more than 20% \u2013 not the sort of level a would-be government should expect. Labour go into the elections still trying to please both leave and remain supporters by promising only to back a second Brexit referendum as a possible option if no constructive deal can be reached. The party risks annoying voters on both sides of the divide. Their campaign has so far been mainly marked by a bitter tussle over the wording on the second referendum pledge, which saw Corbyn emerge triumphant over his pro-People\u2019s Vote deputy, Tom Watson, to the intense anguish of remain backers. Amid this disquiet with the two main parties, who will benefit? The short answer is: the Brexit party. Nigel Farage\u2019s brand new successor-to-Ukip has formally existed for only a few weeks, but is topping polls at about 30% or more, and has unveiled dozens of candidates ranging from former Conservatives to businesspeople and an ex-Marxist. As ever, Farage is presenting a message to the public that is both coherent and vehement \u2013 Brexit is being betrayed \u2013 as well as being distinctly light on details. Farage quit Ukip last year over the party\u2019s hard right, anti-Islam stance under Gerard Batten, and his new venture seems to have well and truly stolen Ukip\u2019s thunder \u2013 after intially strong poll results Ukip has slipped to below 5%, which if confirmed would usher in the party\u2019s likely end as a mainstream force. And remember, under Farage Ukip topped the UK\u2019s vote in 2014. If, as some bill it, the European elections are seen as some sort of proxy second Brexit referendum, the coalescing of leave support around Farage\u2019s group could be an advantage when contrasted with the splits among remainers. Competing for this vote will be the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, as well as Change UK \u2013 the new party set up by 11 former Labour and Tory MPs. Each of them are polling at close to 10%. What will it all mean come the results? No one really knows, beyond one thing \u2013 it\u2019s very unlikely to heal any divisions.

This year, it is a litmus test of whether Angela Merkel\u2019s grand coalition will be able to hang on through the full legislative period to 2021. Or whether it might collapse early.

For the Greens, it is important to convert good poll results into electoral success.

Big European issues are of little concern. Some voters tell campaigners they are concerned about dumping, about tax avoidance, copyright, security and the rise of rightwing populists. But most see this as just another national election, albeit one fought on a bigger stage. Cerstin Gammelin, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung Spain \u2013 Once more unto the polls Spain is well practised at heading to the polls. At the end of April, the country held its third general election in under four years, a landmark vote that saw the ruling socialist workers\u2019 party (PSOE) win the most votes but fall short of a majority, the traditional People\u2019s party (PP) humiliated and the breakthrough of the far-right Vox party. Those results are likely to exert a significant influence on what happens on 26 May, when Spaniards vote in the European elections, but also in regional and municipal ones. The PSOE will be hoping for a post-general election bounce that will see them win the vote and cement the party\u2019s place as the resurgent party of the European centre-left. Equally interesting will be what happens on the right. The advent of Vox, which won 24 seats in congress last month, pushed both the PP and the centre-right Citizens party further to the right as the three parties competed for voters. But the move backfired \u2013 particularly for the PP. After his strategy of cosying up to Vox failed to pay off, the PP\u2019s leader, Pablo Casado, is trying to reclaim the centre-ground and has begun denouncing the party as a far-right outfit. Citizens, meanwhile, is doing its best to stake its claim to that centre-ground and to portray itself as the true party of opposition. Vox is also recalibrating its approach. Although the party picked up 10.3% of the vote in April \u2013 wildly up on the 0.2% it took in the 2016 general election \u2013 it did not do as well as had been predicted. The party, which has followed the populist tactic of favouring social media over traditional media, thinks the approach may have hurt its ability to reach older voters. Mindful that the great majority of Spaniards are pro-European and still regard the country\u2019s entry into the EU as a landmark moment in the country\u2019s history, Vox is taking a different line to many of the continent\u2019s far-right parties. \u201cWe believe in Europe because we are Europe,\u201d says its European election manifesto. But it says the EU is in crisis because it is on hock to \u201ccertain ideologies and political commitments that have seen \u2018the construction of a Europe\u2019 outside the true Europe\u201d. Sam Jones, the Guardian Poland \u2013 Gay rights and child protection \u201cHands off our children,\u201d the leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, intoned in March as the campaign for European parliamentary elections started. But the declaration is proving uncomfortable. Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s intended target was the LGBT community. Awkwardly for Kaczy\u0144ski, it is the Catholic church, a great ally to the PiS, which has been accused of being a far greater threat to children than the gay community. Since it came to power in 2015, PiS has sought to rally its conservative base with sound and fury about attempts to introduce more liberal sexual education in Warsaw and other cities run by the opposition. It seized on statements by the likes of Pawe\u0142 Rabiej, vice-president of Warsaw, who does not hide the fact that he is gay, who has said he is in favour of the legalisation of gay marriage and gay adoption in Poland. One PiS politician running for election, El\u017cbieta Kruk, vowed that Poland should be an LGBT-free land. In another episode, an activist was arrested for hanging posters with an image of the Virgin Mary with a rainbow halo in a church in P\u0142ock. She faces two years in prison for insulting religious feelings. But the moral onslaught did not change the poll ratings. And a backlash was brewing. Last weekend, Tomasz Sekielski, broadcast a film with fresh revelations about paedophilia in the Polish Catholic church. The film accused the church in Poland of covering up cases of child sexual abuse by priests, and transferring perpetrators to other parishes. Almost 8 million people have seen it. The ruling party appear to be floundering, dismissing the paedophile-priests as isolated cases while at the same time raising penalties for paedophilia to up to 30 years in prison. The opposition promised a new commission to investigate paedophilia in the Polish church. All of this is a prelude to national elections in the autumn. Defeat for PiS in May will damage its chances of maintaining its hold on government later in the year. A sudden threat from a new constellation on the far right could erode its popularity further. Poland waits with bated breath. Bartosz T.
