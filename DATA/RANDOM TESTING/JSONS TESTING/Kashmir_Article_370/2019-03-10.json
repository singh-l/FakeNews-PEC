      "body": "<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/\" title=\"\">2019 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona</a> the other week, all the talk was all about 5G, the Newest New Thing in mobile communication technology. If at this stage your eyes begin to glaze over, then you have my sympathy. But stay tuned: this stuff is more intriguing than you might think. And aspects of it are deeply mysterious.</p> <p>First, some basics. Like most technologies, mobile communications goes in \u201cgenerations\u201d. At the moment, we are supposedly in the fourth generation \u2013 which is why you sometimes see \u201c4G\u201d next to the network signal icon on your phone. I say \u201csupposedly\u201d, because if you live outside a major conurbation, you are more likely to see \u201c3G\u201d, which means that you are stuck in the previous generation, despite the fact that the industry likes to pretend that 4G is ubiquitous.</p> <p>The basic idea behind these generational shifts is that things get steadily better for consumers in terms of bandwidth, speed and connection quality. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G\" title=\"\">5G</a> promises vast improvements in terms of high data rates, reduced latency (ie, lag), energy saving, cost reduction, higher system capacity, and massive device connectivity. Just considering data rates, the best that 4G can do at the moment is about 14mbps (megabits per second). Experiments by Verizon in the US suggest that 5G could do between 30 and 50 times better \u2013 downloading a complete movie in 15 seconds, compared with six minutes on 4G. A bigger argument for 5G is not speed, however, but capacity: current mobile technology cannot handle the communications needs of a world with billions of IoT (Internet of Things) devices.</p> <p>A mobile network has two main components: a hard-wired core consisting of a network of base-stations (cell towers) connected by fibre-optic links; and radio links between the towers and consumers\u2019 devices \u2013 the so-called <a href=\"https://digitstodollars.com/2019/03/04/mwc-2019-the-state-of-5g/\" title=\"\">\u201cair interface\u201d</a>. Each generational change has required changes to both components, and 5G will be no different, though the upgrades will be more significant and more difficult to implement. The air interface, in particular, will be much more challenging because it will mean that phones have to communicate with base stations using much higher radio frequencies. (Yes, your phone is a radio transmitter.) The good news is that these frequencies enable huge improvements in speed. The bad news is that the signals don\u2019t travel as far as current frequencies do \u2013 tens of metres compared with kilometres for 4G signals. This implies the need to install hundreds of thousands of new base stations to ensure meaningful coverage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>BT announced it was removing Huawei kit from parts of its 4G network.

The grounds for this are national security concerns about hidden \u201cbackdoors\u201d: it would be risky to have a company so close to the Chinese government building key parts of American critical infrastructure. Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/huawei-sues-us-over-government-ban-on-its-products\" title=\"\">Huawei filed a lawsuit</a> against the US government over the ban.
