It\u2019s a lovely idea but it falls down for one important reason: Corbyn does not have a million pounds lying around to spare, and he cannot create a parliamentary majority to stop Brexit.</p> <p>So why has he promised to do it? Well, just as if Corbyn promised to give you a million pounds you would probably like him more, it comes down to the question of Labour\u2019s electoral viability. Labour is not looking in as healthy a position as it once was , for a variety of reasons. </p> <p>In England, it is being menaced by the creation of a new party, the Independent Group, and in Scotland and Wales it faces losing votes and seats to the two nations\u2019 pro-EU and pro-independence parties, the SNP and Plaid Cymru. </p> <p>So the important question about Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position is not \u201cwhat does it mean for Brexit?\u201d (a question to which the answer is \u201cnothing at all whatsoever\u201d). The important question is \u201cwill it make Labour more popular and see off the threat of TIG, SNP and Plaid Cymru?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/01/stop-brexit-labour-mps-leave-voters-referendum\">And Owen Jones at the Guardian makes much the same argument, saying that on Brexit Corbynism has been forced to triangulate.</a></strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ever since the referendum result upended British politics, it has been claimed by many that Labour is in possession of a big shiny Stop Brexit button that it is spitefully refusing to press. This theory is about to meet its nemesis: political reality. When the amendment falls, there will undoubtedly be relentless attempts to blame <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a>, that it didn\u2019t whip hard enough. But such claims will be based in cynicism rather than truth.</p> <p>Yet there remains a political dilemma for Labour\u2019s leadership. It needs to maintain the support of \u2013 and win more \u2013 economically leftist leave voters, whose voices are rarely heard on social media, but who are nonetheless numerous. After supporting this referendum it will have to tell them: look, we tried to make this work, we resisted relentless pressure for three years, we even endured a split, but the Tories\u2019 disastrous mismanagement of Brexit left us with no option.</p> <p>And it is torn in another direction, too. One of the most striking political phenomena of the last three years is that while the \u201cStop Brexit\u201d campaigns have failed to win over leave voters in any decisive number, they have succeeded in making existing remain voters more angry about Brexit than they were the morning after the referendum result ...</p> <p>Labour has to lovebomb those remain voters, too, emphasising the political chasm that exists between it and a Tory party increasingly dominated by the Rees-Mogg tendency. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c79490ce4b09f04c9ee1ef7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-01T15:11:45.750Z\">3.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">May should have been more robust with EU in Brexit talks, says her former aide Nick Timothy</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As well as speaking to the BBC (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/mar/01/brexit-latest-news-theresa-may-faces-further-backlash-over-decision-to-give-mps-vote-on-extending-article-50-politics-live?page=with:block-5c793026e4b09f04c9ee1d97#block-5c793026e4b09f04c9ee1d97\"> 1.37pm)</a>, <strong>Nick Timothy</strong>, Theresa May\u2019s most influential policy adviser until he resigned after the 2017 general election, has also given an interview to Channel 4 News. In it, he said that May should have been more robust in her dealings with the EU.

He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think one of the reasons we are where we are, is that many ministers - and I would include Theresa in this - struggled to see any economic upside to Brexit.

But then, yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-mcdonnell-says-theres-chance-labour-could-win-vote-for-second-referendum-politics-live?page=with:block-5c77f822e4b09f04c9ee12e3#block-5c77f822e4b09f04c9ee12e3\">George Eustice resigned as fisheries minister </a>because he could not support the move he had voted for less than 24 hours earlier. And this morning there is evidence that the backlash against May\u2019s decision to agree a possible vote to extend article 50 is growing. On the Today programme <strong>Dominic Raab</strong>, the former Brexit secretary (he resigned in November because he opposed the PM\u2019s deal) and one of the many Tories interested in succeeding her as leader, said that he was \u201cstrongly against\u201d delaying Brexit and that talking about an article 50 extension sent the \u201cwrong message\u201d to Brussels.</p> <p>Raab, who did not vote in the division on Tuesday on the article 50 extension amendment, explained: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now we need to stand firm. And I think the point of George Eustice\u2019s resignation ... is that suggesting to the EU that we might delay Brexit, or take no deal off the table, weakens the negotiating leverage in delivering the very aims that the government has set out. And that is what I think is so frustrating ...</p> <p>The issue with delay is at this point in time it weakens our leverage - why would the EU make concessions now? The chances of a deal get that bit slimmer because they are less likely to compromise ...</p> <p>If we have a delay ... the question is what are the challenges that we face now that will get easier after that. I think all our of problems get more difficult. So I\u2019m strongly against any delay, and I think from the EU\u2019s point of view it signals to them that actually their intransigence pays off, and that\u2019s the wrong message for the UK to be sending to Brussels at this moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if he thought a no-deal Brexit would be better than delay, he replied \u201cabsolutely\u201d - echoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-mcdonnell-says-theres-chance-labour-could-win-vote-for-second-referendum-politics-live?page=with:block-5c781065e4b07200085700e0#block-5c781065e4b07200085700e0\">the line adopted yesterday by Boris Johnson,</a> the former foreign secretary (who also resigned because he was opposed to May\u2019s Brexit plan, but four months ahead of Raab).</p> <p>I will post more from the Raab interview shortly.</p> <p>The Commons is not sitting today and the political diary looks fairly empty.

      "bodyText": "The US has outlined its objectives for a post-Brexit trade deal with the UK, demanding greater access to the food markets where products such as chlorinated chicken or hormone-fed beef are banned under EU rules. The government has settled a high court case over the Brexit ferry fiascoby reaching an agreement worth up to \u00a333m with Eurotunnel, which was suing it after the award of a contract to a company with no ships. Legal experts have advised the German parliament that any Brexit delay beyond the European elections on 23-26 May could be in breach of EU law and leave the UK open to legal action, according to a confidential report seen by Die Welt. The Spanish government has approved a series of unilateral contingency measures to protect the rights of Britons in Spain in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Have a good weekend. And, while we are on Brexit, here are two columns published today that should be read by anyone who thinks that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to embrace a second referendum means there is a good chance of one actually happening. Stephen Bush in the i says Corbyn cannot make it happen. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to commit Labour to backing a second referendum is a bit like Corbyn committing to giving you a million pounds out of his own pocket. It\u2019s a lovely idea but it falls down for one important reason: Corbyn does not have a million pounds lying around to spare, and he cannot create a parliamentary majority to stop Brexit. So why has he promised to do it? Well, just as if Corbyn promised to give you a million pounds you would probably like him more, it comes down to the question of Labour\u2019s electoral viability. Labour is not looking in as healthy a position as it once was , for a variety of reasons. In England, it is being menaced by the creation of a new party, the Independent Group, and in Scotland and Wales it faces losing votes and seats to the two nations\u2019 pro-EU and pro-independence parties, the SNP and Plaid Cymru. So the important question about Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position is not \u201cwhat does it mean for Brexit?\u201d (a question to which the answer is \u201cnothing at all whatsoever\u201d). The important question is \u201cwill it make Labour more popular and see off the threat of TIG, SNP and Plaid Cymru?\u201d And Owen Jones at the Guardian makes much the same argument, saying that on Brexit Corbynism has been forced to triangulate. Ever since the referendum result upended British politics, it has been claimed by many that Labour is in possession of a big shiny Stop Brexit button that it is spitefully refusing to press. This theory is about to meet its nemesis: political reality. When the amendment falls, there will undoubtedly be relentless attempts to blame Labour, that it didn\u2019t whip hard enough. But such claims will be based in cynicism rather than truth. Yet there remains a political dilemma for Labour\u2019s leadership. It needs to maintain the support of \u2013 and win more \u2013 economically leftist leave voters, whose voices are rarely heard on social media, but who are nonetheless numerous. After supporting this referendum it will have to tell them: look, we tried to make this work, we resisted relentless pressure for three years, we even endured a split, but the Tories\u2019 disastrous mismanagement of Brexit left us with no option. And it is torn in another direction, too. One of the most striking political phenomena of the last three years is that while the \u201cStop Brexit\u201d campaigns have failed to win over leave voters in any decisive number, they have succeeded in making existing remain voters more angry about Brexit than they were the morning after the referendum result ... Labour has to lovebomb those remain voters, too, emphasising the political chasm that exists between it and a Tory party increasingly dominated by the Rees-Mogg tendency. As well as speaking to the BBC (see 1.37pm), Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s most influential policy adviser until he resigned after the 2017 general election, has also given an interview to Channel 4 News. In it, he said that May should have been more robust in her dealings with the EU. Arguing that the UK had made mistakes in the Brexit talks, he said: Some of it is to do with negotiating style. Theresa was always of the view that the best way to get something out of negotiations, especially in Europe, is to consistently show goodwill and not descend into some of the name-calling and game-playing that sometimes takes place. I think her goodwill has sometimes been pocketed without Britain getting much in return. Timothy also said May thought that the main advantage of Brexit would be that it would allow the UK to control immigration. Theresa\u2019s instincts have been that economically, this is a risk to be managed, but politically this is an opportunity and that main opportunity is to recover control of immigration. If you look at it like that, then you see why the deal she has negotiated actually makes sense and is potentially - according to those objectives - something of a success. But I think that for those of us who see it in much broader sovereignty terms and also see that there are economic opportunities - as well as undoubted risks to be managed - it doesn\u2019t seem quite so successful. The Financial Times\u2019 Alan Beattie has a good Twitter thread on the the US trade deal objectives. (See 10.54am.) It starts here. The National Farmers\u2019 Union has said that any UK-US trade deal must not lead to a lowering of standards in Britain. Responding to the release in Washington of a document setting out the US priorities for a deal (see 10.54am), the NFU president Minette Batters said in a statement: It comes as no surprise that the USA is seeking comprehensive access to the UK\u2019s agricultural market and is pushing for a trade deal that accepts US production standards and practices. The NFU has been very clear on this point. It is imperative that any future trade deals, including a possible deal with the USA, do not allow the imports of food produced to lower standards than those required of British farmers. British people value and demand the high standards of animal welfare, environmental protection and food safety that our own farmers adhere to. These world-leading standards must not be sacrificed in the pursuit of reaching rushed trade deals. We should not accept trade deals which allow food to be imported into this country produced in ways which would be illegal here. This is from my colleague Daniel Boffey in Brussels. The BBC has broadcast extracts from an interview with Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former co chief of staff and her most influential policy adviser until he resigned after the 2017 general election. In it Timothy, a Brexiter who wrote the speeches in which May rejected a soft Brexit early in her premiership, criticises his former boss for not recognising the \u201ceconomic opportunities\u201d of leaving the EU. He says: I think one of the reasons we are where we are, is that many ministers - and I would include Theresa in this - struggled to see any economic upside to Brexit. They see it as a damage limitation exercise. If you see it in that way [as damage limitation] then inevitably you\u2019re not going to be prepared to take the steps that would enable you to fully realise the economic opportunities of leaving. We\u2019ve only seen an extract, and so it is not clear whether or not in the full interview Timothy elaborates on what these economic opportunities actually are. The Treasury has had difficulty identifying them. In its economic impact assessment published in November last year it concluded that the UK would be worse off under all Brexit scenarios than it would be if it remained in the EU. As this chart shows, it did concede that there could be some modest benefits from new trade deals and from the regulatory flexibility available outside the EU. (Look at the wafer-thin bars above the 0% line in the chart below.) But these would not compensate for the far, far bigger negative impact of factors like customs costs, non-tariff barriers and immigrations restrictions (the chunky bars below the 0% line), it argued. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, which wants a second referendum, has published its assessment of the US demands for a trade deal. (See 10.54am.) Rather than focus on the threat to agriculture, it is highlighting a single line in the document under the heading \u201cProcedural fairness for pharmaceuticals and medical devices\u201d which says a US negotiating objective will be to: Seek standards to ensure that government regulatory reimbursement regimes are transparent, provide procedural fairness, are nondiscriminatory, and provide full market access for US products People\u2019s Vote says this means Washington wants to remove rules that limit what American drug companies can charge the NHS. In a statement put out by the campaign, the Labour MP Jo Stevens said: Donald Trump\u2019s administration has now made it clear just what it will be demanding from the UK in return for a trade deal - and one of those things is that we let big US companies run riot in the NHS. One demand of the US is that the NHS pay more to US drug companies and that that US drug companies, the very corporations that have caused the opioids crisis in their home countries through reckless marketing and pressure on doctors, get full access to the NHS \u2013 long a demand from US mega-lobbyists in the pay of Big Pharma. The People\u2019s Vote analysis also claims that the US document shows it wants to end restrictions on the personal data being sent to the US, and that it wants to allow the resale of industrial goods in the UK that are currently banned as waste. This could lead to items that contain materials like asbestos being put on the market, People\u2019s Vote claims. The SNP says Washington\u2019s demands for a UK-US trade deal (see 10.54am) could cause lasting damaging to farming and the food and drink industry in Scotland. In a statement issued by the party, Gail Ross MSP said: The US government\u2019s trade demands couldn\u2019t be clearer \u2013 they want the UK to leave the door wide open to produce like chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef. Not only does that raise questions over health issues given that these products are currently banned by the EU, it is also a direct threat to Scotland\u2019s world class food and drink sector. The Tories have repeatedly failed to ensure that Brexit will not put Scotland\u2019s high-quality food and environmental standards at risk. And if they now give in to Donald Trump\u2019s bargain basement demands, as seems likely, the Tory government runs the risk of causing long-lasting damage to our world-renowned agricultural and farming industries, and our food and drink sector. That reputation could be smashed to pieces if the Tories desperately succumb to every one of the US\u2019s demands. This morning\u2019s Downing Street lobby briefing was dominated by questions about the performance of Chris Grayling, after the beleaguered minister\u2019s department agreed to pay out to ensure the Channel Tunnel is ready to continue to keep passengers and freight moving in a no-deal Brexit scenario. A Downing Street spokesman insisted that the prime minister continued to have confidence in the transport secretary, despite the payout, citing progress he had made on Heathrow development and with rail investment as successes for the minister. Downing Street was also forced to defend Grayling\u2019s time as justice secretary, following a critical report by the National Audit Office into the part-privatisation of the probation service, and said that while his successor David Gauke had been forced to bring back the contracts in-house, 40,000 low and medium risk offenders were now being monitored after release from prison in a way they had not been before. A key plank of Theresa May\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d immigration policy has been declared incompatible with human rights law in a damning ruling handed down at the high court, Amelia Hill and Diane Taylor report. The controversial Right to Rent scheme forces private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants and potential tenants. Unlimited fines or even a prison sentence can be levied under the policy to any landlord who rents to undocumented migrants. In a robust judgement, Mr Justice Spencer said the much-criticised policy was unlawful because it caused landlords to discriminate against British citizens from minority ethnic backgrounds and against foreign nationals who have a legal right to rent. Here is the full story. Tim Farron, the former Lib Dem leader, says the US document setting out its priorities for a trade deal with the UK (see 10.54am) shows the \u201cduplicity\u201d of leave campaigners. In a statement released by the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, Farron said: This shows the duplicity of Leave campaigners. Only last week Michael Gove told the National Farmers\u2019 Union that farmers would be protected by tariffs after Brexit. Now it\u2019s clear that the US won\u2019t allow that in a trade deal and wants to flood us with chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-pumped beef. But the British people won\u2019t be force-fed low quality products or a bad Brexit deal. That\u2019s why we need a public vote. Labour is calling for Chris Grayling\u2019s resignation in the light of the government\u2019s \u00a333m settlement in the Eurotunnel case. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: On the same day a National Audit Office report highlights that disastrous decisions by Chris Grayling at the Ministry of Justice have wasted nearly half a billion pounds of public money we also learn that the transport secretary\u2019s misjudgement over the award of a ferry contract has left taxpayer\u2019s liable for \u00a333m in compensation to Eurotunnel. This follows a damning public accounts committee report on Wednesday on his mismanagement of the railways. His conduct as a minister is one of serial failure and routine incompetence. In any other sphere of life he would have been sacked long ago. I say yet again: this trail of destruction has gone on long enough. It\u2019s time for Chris Grayling to go. Here is my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll\u2019s story on the government settlement with Eurotunnel. (See 10.43am.) And here is how it starts. The government has settled a high court case over the Brexit ferry fiasco, after reaching an agreement worth up to \u00a333m with Eurotunnel which was suing it following the award of a contract to a company with no ships. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said in a statement: \u201cThe agreement with Eurotunnel secures the government\u2019s additional freight capacity, helping ensure that the NHS has essential medicines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Eurotunnel was suing after Grayling awarded a contract for a ferry service to Seaborne Freight from the disused port of Ramsgate. Two other companies, DFDS and Brittany Ferries, were awarded contracts worth \u00a3108m. Washington has confirmed that it wants any UK-US trade deal to remove any barriers to American agricultural produce being sold in Britain. The Office of the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, has set out the demand in a 15-page paper (pdf) setting out the Trump administration\u2019s negotiating objectives for a trade deal. Agriculture is likely to be a flashpoint because the prospect of chlorine-washed chicken (allowed in the US, but banned in the EU) arriving on British shelves has already triggered considerable controversy. It is unusual for a trade policy issue to resonate with the media in the way the chlorinated chicken row has. But in practice it is just one of many areas where differences between US agricultural standards and EU standards could lead to the UK having to make uncomfortable compromises if it wants a trade deal with Washington. The objectives included in the US paper include: Secure comprehensive market access for US agricultural goods in the UK by reducing or eliminating tariffs and Establish a mechanism to remove expeditiously unwarranted barriers that block the export of US food and agricultural products in order to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll has the full story here. The Press Association has snapped this. Eurotunnel has withdrawn its legal claim against the Department for Transport over post-Brexit ferry contracts after reaching an agreement worth up to \u00a333m, the government said today. In his Today interview Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, also accused the EU of being \u201cdishonourable\u201d in its handling of the Brexit negotiations and of trying to \u201cbully\u201d the UK. Referring to George Eustice\u2019s resignation letter yesterday, in which Eustice said \u201cI do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations\u201d, Raab said: George Eustice referred to, frankly, the dishonourable way that they have tried to bully us and shove us around, and it is time for us to stand up and show some mettle, as a government and as a country ... It is very clear that they have used the Northern Ireland protocol and backstop as a means of trying to press on the sensitive issue of Northern Ireland, with all the sensitivities around that, in order effectively to try and lock us into a range of their laws, really just to undercut our competitiveness ... I think trying to use Northern Ireland, given the history of that conflict, given the secessionist tendencies in other European countries, in order to put pressure on us in the way that they have, no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. And, frankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right from the point of view of European unity and solidarity. In response, the SNP MP Joanna Cherry said Raab\u2019s accusation was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. And here is an assessment from Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe academic project. He thinks Raab is wrong about the EU\u2019s motives. On Tuesday night, when just 20 Tory Brexiters voted against the amendment backing the plan to allow MPs a possible vote on extending article 50 (although dozens more abstained), it looked as though the Conservative rebellion against Theresa May\u2019s plan had been contained. But then, yesterday, George Eustice resigned as fisheries minister because he could not support the move he had voted for less than 24 hours earlier. And this morning there is evidence that the backlash against May\u2019s decision to agree a possible vote to extend article 50 is growing. On the Today programme Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary (he resigned in November because he opposed the PM\u2019s deal) and one of the many Tories interested in succeeding her as leader, said that he was \u201cstrongly against\u201d delaying Brexit and that talking about an article 50 extension sent the \u201cwrong message\u201d to Brussels. Raab, who did not vote in the division on Tuesday on the article 50 extension amendment, explained: Now we need to stand firm. And I think the point of George Eustice\u2019s resignation ... is that suggesting to the EU that we might delay Brexit, or take no deal off the table, weakens the negotiating leverage in delivering the very aims that the government has set out. And that is what I think is so frustrating ... The issue with delay is at this point in time it weakens our leverage - why would the EU make concessions now? The chances of a deal get that bit slimmer because they are less likely to compromise ... If we have a delay ... the question is what are the challenges that we face now that will get easier after that. I think all our of problems get more difficult. So I\u2019m strongly against any delay, and I think from the EU\u2019s point of view it signals to them that actually their intransigence pays off, and that\u2019s the wrong message for the UK to be sending to Brussels at this moment. When asked if he thought a no-deal Brexit would be better than delay, he replied \u201cabsolutely\u201d - echoing the line adopted yesterday by Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary (who also resigned because he was opposed to May\u2019s Brexit plan, but four months ahead of Raab). I will post more from the Raab interview shortly. The Commons is not sitting today and the political diary looks fairly empty. But I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find something. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up, probably mid afternoon. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, had announced his impending release in parliament on Thursday, calling it a \u201cpeace gesture\u201d.</p> \n<p>The pilot\u2019s homecoming sparked jubilation in India.

      "bodyText": "Pakistan has returned an Indian pilot who had become the face of the worst military crisis between the two countries in decades, in a gesture aimed at demonstrating its willingness to de-escalate the conflict. Wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was shot down during the first publicly acknowledged dogfight between the countries in 48 years on Wednesday, was returned to India at the Wagah border crossing in Punjab on Friday evening. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, had announced his impending release in parliament on Thursday, calling it a \u201cpeace gesture\u201d. The pilot\u2019s homecoming sparked jubilation in India. Large crowds gathered near the border post cheering, dancing and waving Indian flags in scenes broadcast live on major TV news channels, who counted down the hours to Varthaman\u2019s return throughout the afternoon and evening. A Bollywood filmmaker has already applied to copyright the movie title Abhinandan. Varthaman\u2019s return had been scheduled for the afternoon but was delayed for hours without explanation, leading TV anchors to speculate something may have gone wrong. At around 9.15pm Indian time, he appeared on the Pakistan side of the border crossing, straight-backed and wearing a blue blazer and grey trousers.

The fate of the pilot had become a major concern in India after a series of videos were released showing him being beaten by a mob near his crash site and then interrogated by Pakistani officers while blindfolded and wearing a bloodied uniform. He gave his name, rank and religion, but when prompted for more, calmly replied: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, that\u2019s all I\u2019m supposed to tell you.\u201d The footage was widely circulated on WhatsApp and social media and broadcast nationally in both countries, including on India\u2019s stridently nationalistic evening talk shows. Pakistan appeared to seize on Varthaman\u2019s potential to be a circuit breaker in the conflict by the evening, releasing a video showing the detainee drinking chai, saying he was being treated well and lauding his captors as \u201cthorough gentlemen\u201d. \u201cThe tea is fantastic,\u201d he added.

Kashmir, a Himalayan region the two countries claim in full but rule in part, has been the trigger for three India-Pakistan wars since 1947. The pair regularly trade mortar fire over the heavily guarded line of control separating the two armies, including on Friday as Varthaman was being repatriated. The stakes of the latest flare-up have been heightened by an impending general election in India and the introduction of social media and cable news in both countries, which have created new and influential public lobbies. False news and videos including of pilots killed or injured in earlier accidents and supposed footage of India\u2019s strike on Pakistan that later turned out to be a clip from a video game were also widely circulated. Modi, who is currently campaigning for re-election, trumpeted the strikes against Pakistan from the hustings on Friday. \u201cFrom 2004 to 2014 there were several terror attacks,\u201d he said, speaking at a rally in Tamil Nadu state. \u201cThe nation expected perpetrators to be punished but nothing happened \u2026 Today, we are in an era where the news reads: armed forces have full freedom to do what they want.\u201d Varthaman\u2019s release on Friday was lauded as a \u201ctitanic win for India\u201d by more jingoistic elements of the country\u2019s media, but Khan\u2019s announcement puts pressure on Delhi to reciprocate in a way that eases tensions before it is has necessarily achieved its strategic goals. The current crisis was sparked by a 14 February suicide bombing by a Pakistan-based militant group in the disputed region of Kashmir that killed 40 Indian paramilitaries. Indian jets flew more than 50 miles inside Pakistan to strike what Delhi has said was a militant training centre in reprisal, the first attack on undisputed Pakistani territory since a war between the countries in 1971. Indian government officials said on Thursday the attack was intended to raise the costs for Pakistan of continuing to allow jihadi groups to operate with free rein on its soil. India has previously practised \u201cstrategic restraint\u201d in response to attacks by Pakistan-based militants, including a four-day bombing and shooting operation in Mumbai in 2008 that killed or injured nearly 1,000 people. India wants Pakistan to take verifiable action to show it is cracking down on Islamist militia groups, an issue it says Islamabad has sought to distract from by creating the impression the two nuclear-armed countries are on the brink of war. Pakistani jets struck Indian territory near Kashmir\u2019s ceasefire line on Wednesday morning. Both countries say they shot down an opposing jet in the ensuing aerial combat, including Varthaman\u2019s, which landed in Pakistan-held territory. The clashes led to the closure of airspace across Pakistan and northern India, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded as airlines cancelled flights to the region or scrambled to find alternate routes. Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister, was asked by CNN on Thursday night if his country would arrest Mahmood Azhar, the leader of the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which claimed responsibility for the attack on the Indian paramilitaries. \u201cAccording to my information he is very unwell,\u201d Qureshi said. \u201cHe is unwell to the extent he cannot leave his house.\u201d India has given Pakistan a dossier of evidence on the involvement of Azhar and JeM in the plot. Qureshi has said he would examine the dossier but told CNN that India needed to \u201cgive us evidence which is acceptable to the courts of Pakistan\u201d before it arrested the militant leader. Pakistan has not explained why more evidence than JeM\u2019s claim of responsibility would be necessary. The country\u2019s climate change minister, Malik Amin Aslam, told Reuters on Friday he planned to lodge a complaint against India at the UN, claiming its airstrikes had destroyed pine trees in a forest reserve. \u201cWhat happened over there is environmental terrorism,\u201d Aslam said.",
