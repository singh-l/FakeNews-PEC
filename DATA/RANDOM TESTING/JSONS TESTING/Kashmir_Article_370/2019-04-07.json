Labour sources are insistent they have not walked out of the negotiations, but those close to the talks were amazed at how little appeared to actually be on offer from the government.

He had scrawled on it a short paean to Modi\u2019s chest. It simply read, \u201c56\u201d.</p> \n<p>By calling some of Indian politics\u2019 most basic tenets into question, Modi has caused an earthquake. Before him, contemporary elections were thought to be a game of assembling winning coalitions out of the country\u2019s myriad regional and caste-based parties. No single party had won an outright parliamentary majority in three decades.</p> \n<p>Modi\u2019s popularity is making strange bedfellows of his opponents: political parties that have been bitter enemies for decades, such as UP\u2019s Bahujan Samaj party and the Samajwadi party, are now forming alliances united by little else than the desire to beat him.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>People who have a government job are seen with different eyes, that our daughter will be happy with this guy</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite></cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Will their traditional voters stomach this? Can Modi\u2019s party persuade Hindus to vote as a united bloc instead? Or, as Indians grow richer, will they increasingly be guided by issues, such as Modi\u2019s promises of development, or warnings that his authoritarian style is undermining the country\u2019s democracy?</p> \n<p>Pradeep Chhibber, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, believes India is in flux, and that nobody really knows. \u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t have a theory of the vote,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why Indians vote the way they do. I wish we did.\u201d</p> \n<p>We had met a young man at the rally named Pushpender Baghel, who invited us to see him the following day. He was studying for India\u2019s civil service exams, a notoriously gruelling series of tests demanding knowledge of topics ranging from the origins of the French revolution to the meaning of laissez-faire economics and the composition of clouds.</p> \n<p>About 900,000 people apply each year; fewer than 900 make the cut. The reward is what young Indians and their families prize most: a secure government job.</p> \n<p>Baghel had sequestered himself in a training academy for the past few months before the first stage of the exams in June, studying for at least 10 hours every day. He gave Modi seven marks out of 10. \u201cJobs have not been created as people want. Modi needs to work on this. But five years is not enough time.\u201d </p> \n<p>Modi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/26/narendra-modi-sworn-in-india-prime-minister\" title=\"\">sailed into office in 2014</a> on a wave of young voters. Baghel, 24, belongs to a generation weaned on promises that India is close to becoming a global superpower, and who have adjusted their expectations accordingly.</p> \n<p>But India\u2019s world-beating economic growth is increasingly focused in sectors that are creating fewer formal jobs \u2013 many times less than is required in a country where a million people turn 18 every month.</p> \n<p>Modi was supposed to change that, promising in 2014 to create 250m jobs in a decade. In February <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/indias-jobs-crisis-casts-shadow-over-modis-re-election-hopes\" title=\"\">a leaked government survey</a> \u2013 that Modi disputes, and which his government allegedly tried to suppress \u2013 revealed unemployment has grown on his watch to the highest levels in 45 years.</p> \n<p>And so the allure of a government job remains. \u201cThis expectation is not set by us, it\u2019s set by our community,\u201d Baghel said. \u201cPeople who have a government job are seen with different eyes. People think they have a secure job, that our daughter will be happy with this guy.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was marriage more than the stable income that drove their ambition, he added. \u201cIf marriage wasn\u2019t there, people could do what they want. They could take time to learn, to think critically, or just be on their own. But our community doesn\u2019t permit this.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople want a government job, so they can have prestigious marriages, and their social status can remain at top level,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>After a two-hour drive from Agra, spent mostly on dirt tracks cut into wheat and potato fields that stretched to the horizon, Daujiram Raj appeared before us like a mirage in the village of Banni. His eyes were swollen and he carried a large stick. \u201cThe whole night I\u2019ve been here, like a watchdog over my farm,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Indian farming, an industry that still provides jobs for up to 67% of the country, is in deep trouble. Incomes have fallen to their lowest point in 18 years. Burdened with debts, often on usurious terms from local moneylenders, thousands of farmers are killing themselves each year.</p> \n<p>In Uttar Pradesh, an additional problem has lumbered into view. In 2017, in line with election promises to protect cows, the BJP started enforcing laws against their slaughter that had been on the statute books for years. This disrupted an illegal, if widely accepted, practice among farmers, including Hindu ones, of disposing of unproductive cows by selling them to Muslim-owned abattoirs. Most of those abattoirs are shut now, and old cows and bulls are being abandoned on a mass scale.</p> \n<p>Farmers such as Raj have been forced to fence their crops and spend all night in tiny watch houses, repelling waves of bovine charges. \u201cThere are 200 cows here in this village that attack our fields at night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shine torches in their eyes but sometimes we have to go and shoo them off. They follow us [and] try to kill people who follow them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The cows have divided up Raj\u2019s farmlands like a mafia. \u201cHalf of them will eat from this area,\u201d he said, pointing to one side of the road, \u201cand half will eat from other\u201d. Turf wars are regular. \u201cThey also have their own fights when one eats from the other\u2019s area,\u201d he said. A few metres away, the culprits lounged in what used to be a gooseberry field. They had since denuded it, forcing its owners to pack up and leave for Agra city. About two dozen cows and bulls reclined in the dirt, chewing loudly and twitching their tails, barely raising their heads to look as Raj led us through the field.</p> \n<p>Their imperiousness is not misplaced. The animals are revered by many Hindus as the symbol of non-violence. But some Hindus are willing to do violence to protect them. Modi\u2019s rise has coincided with the formation of vigilante bands across north India, who have killed and wounded dozens of Muslims and low-caste Hindus accused of harming cows.</p> \n<p>Raj and the other farmers are frustrated but fear that driving the animals out, even peacefully, might draw an armed response. \u201cOf course the cow is a goddess for us,\u201d Raj said. \u201cBut now they have become too much for us to handle or feed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Still, he adds, he will be voting for the BJP this year. \u201cThis is the problem we have in our village,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this is sorted out, then we have no problem with the government.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e69f9f50810faec0a77c27f961272cacf91b7829\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e69f9f50810faec0a77c27f961272cacf91b7829/0_338_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A government programme means Pushpa Devi now has natural gas in her home, reducing her use of wood or cow dung for cooking fires.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A government programme means Pushpa Devi now has natural gas in her home, reducing her use of wood or cow dung for cooking fires.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Safi/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We broke up the drive back to Agra near a village called Bamba, stopping for lunch at a farmers\u2019 market. There, Chaudhry Khan Singh sat cross-legged, tending to a boiling pot of chai. \u201cNothing has improved in the past eight years,\u201d he said. But Singh had been paying attention to the way Modi was received in foreign capitals. At home, the Indian leader emphasises his humble background as a railway tea-seller. Abroad, he plays the rock star, giving speeches to screaming stadiums full of Indian migrants in london and New York. In 2015 Modi met Barack Obama while wearing a \u00a310,000 suit patterned with his name written over and over again.</p> \n<p>Critics frequently raise this contradiction, but overlook the jolt of pride people such as Singh feel as they observe the overseas tours. \u201cWhatever respect we have earned outside has been because of Modi,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Despite his glum assessment of India\u2019s progress, Singh had personally benefited from one of Modi\u2019s signature programmes. A few years ago, his household had its first toilet installed, as part of a national drive to reduce diseases associated with public defecation. The government says more than 90m toilets have been built under the programme. Singh was satisfied, but still smarted that a local official had made him pay a bribe to build the facility.</p> \n<p>Listening in, Pushpa Devi, a woman with a broom in hand, said she had recently received a natural gas connection in her house. It was another unsexy Modi government programme that has nonetheless improved lives. With a gas stove, Devi said, she cooked less frequently using wood or cow dung; that meant less of the toxic indoor air pollution that kills a million Indians a year, and fewer hours searching for fuel.</p> \n<p>We invited Devi to sit, but she declined. Out of earshot of the men at the tea stand, she explained that she was a dalit, formerly called the untouchables, India\u2019s least socially powerful caste. She couldn\u2019t sit on our level at a chai stall, she explained. \u201cIf I sit with you, I\u2019m insulting you.\u201d</p> \n<p>Devi voted for Modi in 2014 but only because the head of her village told her to, she said. \u201cWhatever he says, I vote.\u201d She was voting for him again for the same reason, but not enthusiastically. \u201cExcept for the [gas] cylinders, I don\u2019t see that he\u2019s done anything for me. I can\u2019t open my mouth, I can\u2019t drink from the government water supply,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Yet on election day, her headman would lead her and others to the voting booth. \u201cWhen there is an election, that time they will not say I\u2019m untouchable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey put me in the line with everybody else.\u201d</p> \n<p>Back in one of Agra\u2019s older quarters, metal roller-doors were being slammed shut on rows of meat shops in a predominantly Muslim street. In a basement, Sami Aghai sat by a fan in a cramped office. \u201cMuslims will vote for Congress,\u201d he said, referring to India\u2019s establishment party, which has produced three prime ministers and just inducted a latest family member, Priyanka Gandhi, into national politics. \u201cWe have no alternative.\u201d</p> \n<p>Modi\u2019s rise has been confrontational for many Muslims. He is a lifelong adherent of the Hindu nationalist movement. Hindutva, as it is known, is a political ideology distinct from Hinduism, the faith. It emerged as part of a global wave of rightwing nationalist movements in the 1920s, and envisages Hindus as a single nation with a sacred culture that should be emphasised above all others. Consigned to the margins, in this vision, are India\u2019s millions of minority citizens, including the almost 200-million-strong Muslim population.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2b8a63f9b85d7960a04036a99e53df40dd996a55\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b8a63f9b85d7960a04036a99e53df40dd996a55/0_104_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Narendra Modi attend an election campaign rally in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Narendra Modi attend an election campaign rally in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adnan Abidi/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe BJP has destroyed communal harmony in the past five years,\u201d said Aghai, the national president of the Indian Muslim Development Council.</p> \n<p>While Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, the state witnessed its worst religious riots this century, when at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were slaughtered. There has been no such rioting in the past five years, but individual attacks on Muslims have surged, according to a database tracking bias crimes.</p> \n<p>India\u2019s Muslim heritage is also being gradually undermined in myriad ways, petty and consequential. Allahabad, a city in Uttar Pradesh, was recently restored to its pre-Islamic era name, Prayagraj. Foreign dignitaries who visit the state no longer receive models of the Taj Mahal as souvenirs, because they \u201cdo not reflect Indian culture\u201d, according to the chief minister, Yogi Adityanath \u2013 himself a Hindutva firebrand who has spent time in jail on charges of fomenting anti-Muslim violence.</p> \n<p>Aghai flicked through the camera roll of his phone, showing pictures of Muslims and low-caste Hindus who have been lynched in the past five years. \u201cRemember me when you vote,\u201d was written under each photograph. \u201cI got these on Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever I go somewhere for social work, I show them these photos.\u201d</p> \n<p>India\u2019s online population has doubled in the past five years to 500 million people. India is the largest market for both Facebook and WhatsApp. The proliferation of smartphones is changing every facet of Indian life, including politics, and both platforms have rolled out extensive measures to combat disinformation and fake news. But only so much can be filtered.</p> \n<p>A woman\u2019s dulcet voice began to play from Aghai\u2019s phone, a menacing song that has gone viral since a militant from the disputed Kashmir region killed 40 Indian paramilitaries in February.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe soldiers who were martyred in Pulwama were not killed by our enemies,\u201d the sweet voice sang. \u201cThey lost their lives because someone from our own country betrayed us. Our enemies are in our own house. You keep accusing our neighbours \u2013 why don\u2019t you kill those who are ready to stab us in the back?\u201d</p> \n<p>Our last stop before leaving Agra was the home of the man who the city\u2019s politicians seek out when they want an electoral edge. \u201cOur soul knows everything,\u201d declared numerologist Ritu Vardhan Sharma as we sat in his cavernous living room, bare but for a table, some chairs, and an African grey parrot in the corner. \u201cIt knows what is going to happen in this world and what will happen in the future.\u201d He motioned at a pendulum and two dowsing instruments on his table. \u201cWhen we hold these, our soul gives a message to our muscles, and the muscles give the results by the instruments.\u201d</p> \n<p>Astrology is serious business in India, and many, including politicians, still seek the counsel of a local diviner before making decisions. \u201cWhen they see me, only one question is there,\u201d says Sharma, a burly man in flowing white Indian dress. \u201cAm I winning or not?\u201d</p> \n<p>He had agreed to provide us the same service, predicting who would triumph when votes are counted on 23 May. He carefully wrote the possible seat totals for the BJP horizontally across a sheet of paper. Then he lifted the copper pendulum and shut his eyes.</p> \n<p>For the next few minutes, Sharma entered a state of intense focus, undisturbed by our presence, nor by the pulsing beat of LMFAO\u2019s Sexy and You Know It blaring from his daughter\u2019s bedroom upstairs. The pendulum, which had swung wildly, began to settle and then swing determinedly towards one outcome on the sheet: a minimum 275-seat BJP majority.</p> \n<p>Sharma was ready to make his prediction. \u201cI can give you a guarantee that the prime minister will be Narendra Modi,\u201d he declared. \u201c100%.\u201d</p> \n<p>The people we met in Agra had not been so enthusiastic. The realities of governing have taken the sheen off Modi. But voters in Uttar Pradesh still wanted to believe in him: that an Indian leader could deliver dynamic, incorruptible government; that an ageing prime minister really could have a 56-inch chest.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Spend enough time discussing Indian politics this year and you will inevitably find yourself contemplating the chest proportions of a 68-year-old man. In Agra, the north Indian city famous for the Taj Mahal, it only took a few minutes. \u201cHe has a 56-inch chest,\u201d Harsh Bhagal said when asked why he supports India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi. It is a boast the Indian leader first made on the campaign trail in 2014. His opponents laughed, but five years later, 23-year-old Bhagal is preparing to cast his first vote for the Bharatiya Janata Janata party (BJP), inspired by its strongman leader. \u201cWhen Pakistan attacked us in Kashmir [in February],\u201d he said \u2013 pausing momentarily to take a selfie of our interview \u2013 \u201cModi waited 13 days for the Hindu mourning period. Then he retaliated.\u201d Up to 900 million people, an eighth of the world\u2019s population, will vote in India\u2019s gargantuan elections, that start on 11 April and continue for six weeks. Their choice will be driven by local grievances, national issues, their caste or class, and rumours and misinformation shared online. Above all, however, it will be a referendum on Modi, the country\u2019s most powerful and polarising prime minister in generations. Agra is a competitive seat in Uttar Pradesh, the most fiercely contested state in the country. With a population believed to be greater than Brazil\u2019s, UP, as the state is known, offers 80 of the Indian parliament\u2019s 543 seats \u2013 enough to make or break Indian governments. Modi swept it at the last election. Can he do it again? The Observer hit the campaign trail to try to find out. The starting point was a rally in Agra late last month where the BJP was launching its state campaign in front of thousands of people, with dozens more watching from nearby rooftops. A half dozen small cooling fans worked pointlessly to dent the heat. Snipes against Pakistan, India\u2019s arch-rival with which it has clashed for more than half a century, raised the loudest cheers. The chief guest was the BJP\u2019s president, Amit Shah, who was presented on stage with a garland the audience was told weighed a mighty 51kg. \u201cTo give back to Pakistan,\u201d roared Shah, \u201cto fight back against terrorism, to fight corruption, you should choose our prime minister.\u201d Curious how the rally\u2019s muscular rhetoric was impressing female voters, I asked a group of women in bright saris if they supported Modi. They agreed they did, but not with a conviction that withstood scrutiny. \u201cWe are poor people,\u201d said one dressed in teal, who didn\u2019t want to give her name. \u201cA BJP lady came to our village and told us to come. We just go where people tell us. If you ask us to go somewhere, we go.\u201d Fighting Pakistan was fine, she said, but Modi had not delivered on what mattered to her most. \u201cJobs,\u201d she said. \u201cOur kids are educated, they\u2019re filling out forms, but they\u2019re not getting work. I have three daughters and a son. I have to get them married, but none has a job.\u201d Was she voting for Modi? \u201cLast time we gave [our votes] to him,\u201d she said, to murmurs of agreement among the women. \u201cBut this time we won\u2019t.\u201d By the exit gate, a Modi fan dressed in the Indian tricolours wore a portrait of the Indian leader around his neck. He had scrawled on it a short paean to Modi\u2019s chest. It simply read, \u201c56\u201d. By calling some of Indian politics\u2019 most basic tenets into question, Modi has caused an earthquake. Before him, contemporary elections were thought to be a game of assembling winning coalitions out of the country\u2019s myriad regional and caste-based parties. No single party had won an outright parliamentary majority in three decades. Modi\u2019s popularity is making strange bedfellows of his opponents: political parties that have been bitter enemies for decades, such as UP\u2019s Bahujan Samaj party and the Samajwadi party, are now forming alliances united by little else than the desire to beat him. Will their traditional voters stomach this? Can Modi\u2019s party persuade Hindus to vote as a united bloc instead? Or, as Indians grow richer, will they increasingly be guided by issues, such as Modi\u2019s promises of development, or warnings that his authoritarian style is undermining the country\u2019s democracy? Pradeep Chhibber, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, believes India is in flux, and that nobody really knows. \u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t have a theory of the vote,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why Indians vote the way they do. I wish we did.\u201d We had met a young man at the rally named Pushpender Baghel, who invited us to see him the following day. He was studying for India\u2019s civil service exams, a notoriously gruelling series of tests demanding knowledge of topics ranging from the origins of the French revolution to the meaning of laissez-faire economics and the composition of clouds. About 900,000 people apply each year; fewer than 900 make the cut. The reward is what young Indians and their families prize most: a secure government job. Baghel had sequestered himself in a training academy for the past few months before the first stage of the exams in June, studying for at least 10 hours every day. He gave Modi seven marks out of 10. \u201cJobs have not been created as people want. Modi needs to work on this. But five years is not enough time.\u201d Modi sailed into office in 2014 on a wave of young voters. Baghel, 24, belongs to a generation weaned on promises that India is close to becoming a global superpower, and who have adjusted their expectations accordingly. But India\u2019s world-beating economic growth is increasingly focused in sectors that are creating fewer formal jobs \u2013 many times less than is required in a country where a million people turn 18 every month. Modi was supposed to change that, promising in 2014 to create 250m jobs in a decade. In February a leaked government survey \u2013 that Modi disputes, and which his government allegedly tried to suppress \u2013 revealed unemployment has grown on his watch to the highest levels in 45 years. And so the allure of a government job remains. \u201cThis expectation is not set by us, it\u2019s set by our community,\u201d Baghel said. \u201cPeople who have a government job are seen with different eyes. People think they have a secure job, that our daughter will be happy with this guy.\u201d It was marriage more than the stable income that drove their ambition, he added. \u201cIf marriage wasn\u2019t there, people could do what they want. They could take time to learn, to think critically, or just be on their own. But our community doesn\u2019t permit this. \u201cPeople want a government job, so they can have prestigious marriages, and their social status can remain at top level,\u201d he said. After a two-hour drive from Agra, spent mostly on dirt tracks cut into wheat and potato fields that stretched to the horizon, Daujiram Raj appeared before us like a mirage in the village of Banni. His eyes were swollen and he carried a large stick. \u201cThe whole night I\u2019ve been here, like a watchdog over my farm,\u201d he said. Indian farming, an industry that still provides jobs for up to 67% of the country, is in deep trouble. Incomes have fallen to their lowest point in 18 years. Burdened with debts, often on usurious terms from local moneylenders, thousands of farmers are killing themselves each year. In Uttar Pradesh, an additional problem has lumbered into view. In 2017, in line with election promises to protect cows, the BJP started enforcing laws against their slaughter that had been on the statute books for years. This disrupted an illegal, if widely accepted, practice among farmers, including Hindu ones, of disposing of unproductive cows by selling them to Muslim-owned abattoirs. Most of those abattoirs are shut now, and old cows and bulls are being abandoned on a mass scale. Farmers such as Raj have been forced to fence their crops and spend all night in tiny watch houses, repelling waves of bovine charges. \u201cThere are 200 cows here in this village that attack our fields at night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shine torches in their eyes but sometimes we have to go and shoo them off. They follow us [and] try to kill people who follow them.\u201d The cows have divided up Raj\u2019s farmlands like a mafia. \u201cHalf of them will eat from this area,\u201d he said, pointing to one side of the road, \u201cand half will eat from other\u201d. Turf wars are regular. \u201cThey also have their own fights when one eats from the other\u2019s area,\u201d he said. A few metres away, the culprits lounged in what used to be a gooseberry field. They had since denuded it, forcing its owners to pack up and leave for Agra city. About two dozen cows and bulls reclined in the dirt, chewing loudly and twitching their tails, barely raising their heads to look as Raj led us through the field. Their imperiousness is not misplaced. The animals are revered by many Hindus as the symbol of non-violence. But some Hindus are willing to do violence to protect them. Modi\u2019s rise has coincided with the formation of vigilante bands across north India, who have killed and wounded dozens of Muslims and low-caste Hindus accused of harming cows. Raj and the other farmers are frustrated but fear that driving the animals out, even peacefully, might draw an armed response. \u201cOf course the cow is a goddess for us,\u201d Raj said. \u201cBut now they have become too much for us to handle or feed.\u201d Still, he adds, he will be voting for the BJP this year. \u201cThis is the problem we have in our village,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this is sorted out, then we have no problem with the government.\u201d We broke up the drive back to Agra near a village called Bamba, stopping for lunch at a farmers\u2019 market. There, Chaudhry Khan Singh sat cross-legged, tending to a boiling pot of chai. \u201cNothing has improved in the past eight years,\u201d he said. But Singh had been paying attention to the way Modi was received in foreign capitals. At home, the Indian leader emphasises his humble background as a railway tea-seller. Abroad, he plays the rock star, giving speeches to screaming stadiums full of Indian migrants in london and New York. In 2015 Modi met Barack Obama while wearing a \u00a310,000 suit patterned with his name written over and over again. Critics frequently raise this contradiction, but overlook the jolt of pride people such as Singh feel as they observe the overseas tours. \u201cWhatever respect we have earned outside has been because of Modi,\u201d he said. Despite his glum assessment of India\u2019s progress, Singh had personally benefited from one of Modi\u2019s signature programmes. A few years ago, his household had its first toilet installed, as part of a national drive to reduce diseases associated with public defecation. The government says more than 90m toilets have been built under the programme. Singh was satisfied, but still smarted that a local official had made him pay a bribe to build the facility. Listening in, Pushpa Devi, a woman with a broom in hand, said she had recently received a natural gas connection in her house. It was another unsexy Modi government programme that has nonetheless improved lives. With a gas stove, Devi said, she cooked less frequently using wood or cow dung; that meant less of the toxic indoor air pollution that kills a million Indians a year, and fewer hours searching for fuel. We invited Devi to sit, but she declined. Out of earshot of the men at the tea stand, she explained that she was a dalit, formerly called the untouchables, India\u2019s least socially powerful caste. She couldn\u2019t sit on our level at a chai stall, she explained. \u201cIf I sit with you, I\u2019m insulting you.\u201d Devi voted for Modi in 2014 but only because the head of her village told her to, she said. \u201cWhatever he says, I vote.\u201d She was voting for him again for the same reason, but not enthusiastically. \u201cExcept for the [gas] cylinders, I don\u2019t see that he\u2019s done anything for me. I can\u2019t open my mouth, I can\u2019t drink from the government water supply,\u201d she said. Yet on election day, her headman would lead her and others to the voting booth. \u201cWhen there is an election, that time they will not say I\u2019m untouchable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey put me in the line with everybody else.\u201d Back in one of Agra\u2019s older quarters, metal roller-doors were being slammed shut on rows of meat shops in a predominantly Muslim street. In a basement, Sami Aghai sat by a fan in a cramped office. \u201cMuslims will vote for Congress,\u201d he said, referring to India\u2019s establishment party, which has produced three prime ministers and just inducted a latest family member, Priyanka Gandhi, into national politics. \u201cWe have no alternative.\u201d Modi\u2019s rise has been confrontational for many Muslims. He is a lifelong adherent of the Hindu nationalist movement. Hindutva, as it is known, is a political ideology distinct from Hinduism, the faith. It emerged as part of a global wave of rightwing nationalist movements in the 1920s, and envisages Hindus as a single nation with a sacred culture that should be emphasised above all others. Consigned to the margins, in this vision, are India\u2019s millions of minority citizens, including the almost 200-million-strong Muslim population. \u201cThe BJP has destroyed communal harmony in the past five years,\u201d said Aghai, the national president of the Indian Muslim Development Council. While Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, the state witnessed its worst religious riots this century, when at least 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were slaughtered. There has been no such rioting in the past five years, but individual attacks on Muslims have surged, according to a database tracking bias crimes. India\u2019s Muslim heritage is also being gradually undermined in myriad ways, petty and consequential. Allahabad, a city in Uttar Pradesh, was recently restored to its pre-Islamic era name, Prayagraj. Foreign dignitaries who visit the state no longer receive models of the Taj Mahal as souvenirs, because they \u201cdo not reflect Indian culture\u201d, according to the chief minister, Yogi Adityanath \u2013 himself a Hindutva firebrand who has spent time in jail on charges of fomenting anti-Muslim violence. Aghai flicked through the camera roll of his phone, showing pictures of Muslims and low-caste Hindus who have been lynched in the past five years. \u201cRemember me when you vote,\u201d was written under each photograph. \u201cI got these on Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever I go somewhere for social work, I show them these photos.\u201d India\u2019s online population has doubled in the past five years to 500 million people. India is the largest market for both Facebook and WhatsApp. The proliferation of smartphones is changing every facet of Indian life, including politics, and both platforms have rolled out extensive measures to combat disinformation and fake news. But only so much can be filtered. A woman\u2019s dulcet voice began to play from Aghai\u2019s phone, a menacing song that has gone viral since a militant from the disputed Kashmir region killed 40 Indian paramilitaries in February. \u201cThe soldiers who were martyred in Pulwama were not killed by our enemies,\u201d the sweet voice sang. \u201cThey lost their lives because someone from our own country betrayed us. Our enemies are in our own house. You keep accusing our neighbours \u2013 why don\u2019t you kill those who are ready to stab us in the back?\u201d Our last stop before leaving Agra was the home of the man who the city\u2019s politicians seek out when they want an electoral edge. \u201cOur soul knows everything,\u201d declared numerologist Ritu Vardhan Sharma as we sat in his cavernous living room, bare but for a table, some chairs, and an African grey parrot in the corner. \u201cIt knows what is going to happen in this world and what will happen in the future.\u201d He motioned at a pendulum and two dowsing instruments on his table. \u201cWhen we hold these, our soul gives a message to our muscles, and the muscles give the results by the instruments.\u201d Astrology is serious business in India, and many, including politicians, still seek the counsel of a local diviner before making decisions. \u201cWhen they see me, only one question is there,\u201d says Sharma, a burly man in flowing white Indian dress. \u201cAm I winning or not?\u201d He had agreed to provide us the same service, predicting who would triumph when votes are counted on 23 May. He carefully wrote the possible seat totals for the BJP horizontally across a sheet of paper. Then he lifted the copper pendulum and shut his eyes. For the next few minutes, Sharma entered a state of intense focus, undisturbed by our presence, nor by the pulsing beat of LMFAO\u2019s Sexy and You Know It blaring from his daughter\u2019s bedroom upstairs. The pendulum, which had swung wildly, began to settle and then swing determinedly towards one outcome on the sheet: a minimum 275-seat BJP majority. Sharma was ready to make his prediction. \u201cI can give you a guarantee that the prime minister will be Narendra Modi,\u201d he declared. \u201c100%.\u201d The people we met in Agra had not been so enthusiastic. The realities of governing have taken the sheen off Modi. But voters in Uttar Pradesh still wanted to believe in him: that an Indian leader could deliver dynamic, incorruptible government; that an ageing prime minister really could have a 56-inch chest.",
