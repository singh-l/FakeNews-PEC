That released a cavalcade of wickets, three for bobbins in a collapse of seven for 23, from sublime Duanne Olivier yorkers to the ridiculous \u2013 Morne Morkel run out without facing. A 58-ball one from Jordan Clark was followed by a stoic four from Gareth Batty, all the time guided by Jamie Smith, the 18-year- old causing palpitations all around the ground and who finished 24 not out. But it was not enough.</p> <p><strong>Durham</strong>\u2019s<strong> </strong>captain, Cameron Bancroft, guided his side to an unlikely draw at Sedbergh. <strong>Lancashire</strong>, hampered by the non-bowling Jimmy Anderson, who had batted with a runner, and Liam Livingstone also off the field injured, set Durham 304. Saqib Mahmood was unplayable early on, bowling both Alex Lees and Graham Clark for ducks. But Bancroft, unbeaten on 92, found enough support to bat the game out.</p> <p><strong>Glamorgan</strong>, therefore, remain top of Division Two after drawing with <strong>Worcestershire</strong> at a sun-dappled Sophia Gardens, where Worcestershire were not tempted to chase down a declaration target of 326 in 66 overs. Marnus Labuschagne had earlier reached his second hundred of the game; and Brett D\u2019Oliveira took two more wickets to finish with nine, plus a century.</p> <p>At Taunton <strong>Somerset </strong>easily beat <strong>Hampshire</strong> with Jack Leach taking three for 14 and Dom Bess two for 12. <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> fell to their fifth defeat of the season, lasting till after lunch thanks to 35 from Ravi Ashwin. Simon Harmer took four for 35 and remains the country\u2019s leading wicket-taker with 49.</p> <p>The run-fest at the County Ground was given some afternoon spice when <strong>Derbyshire</strong> collapsed to 39 for four in their second innings but Luis du Plooy calmed nerves with an unbeaten 69, on top of a first-innings century. Dawid Malan was earlier out for 199 as <strong>Middlesex</strong>, too, passed 500. <strong>Warwickshire</strong> and <strong>Kent </strong>shook hands on a high-scoring draw on a Canterbury featherbed, where Dom Sibley made a career-best 244.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1cfcd68f08efcbe532c671\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T19:14:03.928Z\">8.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>What a great finish at Scarborough! </strong>Duanne Olivier snaring Gareth Batty with just ten balls to spare. And an audience of over 11,000 watched over the four days too- well done YCCC. Elsewhere, a Cameron Bancroft inspired Durham fought off a reduced Lancashire attack, Notts lost again, Somerset won again, and there were draws at Derby, Sophia Gardens and Canterbury. Runs galore, collapses to gulp at, ridiculous run outs, sensational catches: another smashing round of Championship cricket. And it all starts again on Sunday.

I\u2019m off to the dentist first thing, though hope to be back in good time for the start of play. Here\u2019s a quick round-up of what went on yesterday:</p> <blockquote> <p>A month away from the Ashes, there was a nasty scare for both England and <strong>Lancashire</strong> when James Anderson limped off the pitch at Sedbergh clutching his right calf just eight balls into his first spell of the day. He aborted his run-up three times before hobbling off with a hand on his right leg and is set to have a scan to assess the full extent of the damage. He may bat in the remainder of Lancashire\u2019s match against <strong>Durham</strong>, but won\u2019t bowl. It added to England\u2019s worries on the day they learnt that former Australian captain and galactico Steve Waugh will mentor Australia\u2019s Ashes squad during their tour of England. </p> <p>To rub salt to the wound, Marnus Labuschagne, <strong>Glamorgan</strong>\u2019s blue riband import, and Australia\u2019s incumbent No.4, became the first to a thousand County Championship runs on the way to an unbeaten 90 against <strong>Worcestershire</strong>, and his county cap. In the same game at Sophia Gardens, Brett D\u2019Oliveria completed a pinch-yourself couple of days with a century to add to Monday\u2019s seven wicket haul.</p> <p>On the batting paradise at Canterbury, <strong>Warwickshire</strong>\u2019s Dom Sibley waved his own Ashes flag with an unbeaten double-century against <strong>Kent</strong>, his fourth first-class hundred of the year. While at Trent Bridge, Ravi Bopara made a stylish hundred as <strong>Essex</strong> totted up 519 for seven before <strong>Notts</strong>\u2019 shell-shocked troops limped to 100 for five, still 205 behind. Second-placed Essex will have an eye on victory tomorrow to keep up the pressure on leaders Somerset, who declared on 358 for five at Taunton. Hampshire, chasing 418, were 12 for 1 at the close.</p> <p><strong>Surrey</strong> and <strong>Yorkshire</strong> continued their intriguing battle at Scarborough. Adam Lyth made 63 and Sam Curran took three for 75. Yorkshire go into the last day with a lead of 268 with one wicket remaining. </p> <p>Dane Vilas nurdled a <strong>Lancashire</strong> recovery from the unpromising position of 0-2, as Chris Rushworth dismissed both Keaton Jennings and Haseeb Hameed for ducks in his first over of the day. Earlier <strong>Durham</strong>\u2019s tail had collapsed as they lost five wickets for 18 against an Anderson-less Lancashire attack.</p> <p>At Hove, <strong>Northants</strong> beat <strong>Sussex </strong>in three days, after Sussex\u2019s batsmen were again filleted, this time, for 105. Ben Sanderson took four for 18 to give him match figures of 10 for 50. The 393 run defeat was Sussex\u2019s worst in Championship cricket. At the County Ground, Dawid Malan clocked up 177 not out, after <strong>Middlesex</strong> fought back against <strong>Derby</strong>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T08:52:39.069Z\">at 9.52am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "There was a nail-nibblingy close finish at Scarborough where Yorkshire grabbed the new ball with three overs of the day left and bowled out the reigning champions Surrey with 10 deliveries left. Set a target of 318 to win, Surrey seemed to be easing to victory at 157 for two just before tea until Dean Elgar was run out for 71. That released a cavalcade of wickets, three for bobbins in a collapse of seven for 23, from sublime Duanne Olivier yorkers to the ridiculous \u2013 Morne Morkel run out without facing. A 58-ball one from Jordan Clark was followed by a stoic four from Gareth Batty, all the time guided by Jamie Smith, the 18-year- old causing palpitations all around the ground and who finished 24 not out. But it was not enough. Durham\u2019s captain, Cameron Bancroft, guided his side to an unlikely draw at Sedbergh. Lancashire, hampered by the non-bowling Jimmy Anderson, who had batted with a runner, and Liam Livingstone also off the field injured, set Durham 304. Saqib Mahmood was unplayable early on, bowling both Alex Lees and Graham Clark for ducks. But Bancroft, unbeaten on 92, found enough support to bat the game out. Glamorgan, therefore, remain top of Division Two after drawing with Worcestershire at a sun-dappled Sophia Gardens, where Worcestershire were not tempted to chase down a declaration target of 326 in 66 overs. Marnus Labuschagne had earlier reached his second hundred of the game; and Brett D\u2019Oliveira took two more wickets to finish with nine, plus a century. At Taunton Somerset easily beat Hampshire with Jack Leach taking three for 14 and Dom Bess two for 12. Nottinghamshire fell to their fifth defeat of the season, lasting till after lunch thanks to 35 from Ravi Ashwin. Simon Harmer took four for 35 and remains the country\u2019s leading wicket-taker with 49. The run-fest at the County Ground was given some afternoon spice when Derbyshire collapsed to 39 for four in their second innings but Luis du Plooy calmed nerves with an unbeaten 69, on top of a first-innings century. Dawid Malan was earlier out for 199 as Middlesex, too, passed 500. Warwickshire and Kent shook hands on a high-scoring draw on a Canterbury featherbed, where Dom Sibley made a career-best 244. What a great finish at Scarborough! Duanne Olivier snaring Gareth Batty with just ten balls to spare. And an audience of over 11,000 watched over the four days too- well done YCCC. Elsewhere, a Cameron Bancroft inspired Durham fought off a reduced Lancashire attack, Notts lost again, Somerset won again, and there were draws at Derby, Sophia Gardens and Canterbury. Runs galore, collapses to gulp at, ridiculous run outs, sensational catches: another smashing round of Championship cricket. And it all starts again on Sunday. Thanks as always for all the emails and comments BTL. Good night! Cameron Bancroft , with an unbeaten 92, guides Durham to an unexpected draw at Sedbergh against a Lancashire attack shorn of both James Anderson and Liam Livingstone. Lancashire now sit in Glamorgan\u2019s tailwind in the Division Two table, with a game in hand. Durham rise to eighth. A thriller! Blimey, make a cup of tea and Clark\u2019s 58 ball epic is ended, bowled Olivier for one. And Morkel run out without facing. OR is it Smith? The BBC can\u2019t make its mind up. Surely they can\u2019t both be run out by Kohler-Cadmore? Ah, it was Morkel. Good decision boys. All down to Gareth Batty and Smith now. What a good game! Nine wickets and a century for Brett D\u2019Oliveira; two centuries and a thousand runs for Marnus Labuschagne and a tempting declaration and a doughty response. Glamorgan remain unbeaten and - for now - top; Worcestershire move up to sixth in a crowded middle-order and have a game in hand over every team above them. So just two to watch now....Jordan Clark in the midst of an outstanding 45 ball 0 not out at Scarborough - Surrey 177 for 7. Jamie Smith 17 not out. And at Sedbergh, Cameron Bancroft is still there unbeaten on 72, Lancashire need four wickets, off twenty overs. Handshakes at the end of another high-scoring game. Derbyshire survive a late attack of the collie-wobbles, thanks to Leus du Plooy who added an unbeaten 69 to his first-innings century. Derby now a heady fourth in the Division Two table, Middlesex slip to eighth. Derby: Derbyshire 557-6dec (Reece 96, Godleman 102, du Plooy 118) and 178-6dec v Middlesex 520 (Malan 199, Simpson 115) All over, just 11 short of matching scores. Kent take ten points, Warwicks nine. Fifth placed Kent next play Surrey at The Oval, while Warwicks go to the Rose Bowl. Canterbury: Kent 585-7dec (Dickson 161, Bell-Drummond 166) v Warwickshire 574-7 (Rhodes 109; Sibley 244) The tension is building at Canterbury - will Warwickshire overtake Kent before they shake hands and retire to the beer tent? Just 24 runs will do it. Steven Mullaney had to troop down to face the press again at Trent Bridge. Not a pleasant experience for anyone. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got any excuses. We have been outplayed again. If we don\u2019t do well I don\u2019t make excuses but we need to turn it round and try and put on a show for the last six games.\u201d Maharaj gets another! Clarke for the third duck of Surrey\u2019s innngs! 163-7... Surrey toss the script over the boundary and onto South Bay. Maharaj earning his (possibly) big bucks by dismissing Ryan Patel for nine. The Surrey pair at the crease are the boy with the world at his feet, Jamie Smith, and the walk-in-wardrobe Rikki Clarke. They need another 155 with four wickets left. Liam Livingstone off the field too at Sedbergh - Durham need 170 to win, or have a session to survive. And some related news, Lancashire Thunder have re-signed Indian T20 captain Harmanpreet Kaur for the summer. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 585-7dec (Dickson 161, Bell-Drummond 166) v Warwickshire 531-7 (Rhodes 109; Sibley 244) Scarborough: Yorkshire 327 (Fraine 106; Clark 5-77) and 352 (S Curran 3-90) v Surrey 362 (Stoneman 100) and 159-5 (Elgar 71). Surrey need 159 to win. DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 557-6dec (Reece 96, Godleman 102, du Plooy 118) and 126-4 v Middlesex 520 (Malan 199, Simpson 115) Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 449 (Labuschagne 106; Lloyd 97; D\u2019Oliverira 7-92) and 246-5dec (Labuschagne 100, D\u2019Oliveira 2-90) v Worcestershire 370 (D\u2019Oliveira 103; Hogan 5-62) and 107-1 (Ferguson 55 not out). Worcestershire need 219 to win. Sedbergh: Lancashire 337 (Vilas 72) and 247 (Vilas 85; Rimmington 4-42) v Durham 281 (Bancroft 77; Onions 5-93) and 122-5 (Saqib Mahmood 2-29; Bancroft 57 not out). Durham need 182 to win. Results Trent Bridge: Essex win by an innings and 23 runs. Nottinghamshire 213 (Mullaney 74) and 183 (Duckett 39, Ashwin 35; Harmer 4-35) v Essex 519-9dec (Browne 163, Bopara 135; Ravi Ashwin 3-162) Hove: Northants beat Sussex by 393 runs. Northamptonshire 273 (Zaib 54; Robinson 6-63) and 331 (Vasconcelos 88;Robinson 5-69); Sussex 106 (Sanderson 6-37) and 105 ( Brown 46; Sanderson 4-18, Hutton 4-32) Taunton: Somerset beat Hampshire by 313 runs. Somerset 408 (Hildreth 105; Abbott 6-84) and 353-8dec (Azhar 79 ) v Hampshire 349 (Northeast 101; Jamie Overton 5-70) and 104-9 (Leach 3-14) Derby, boringly, pulling up the drawbridge, just when it was getting exciting. Now 120 for four, with du Plooy and Hussein both in the forties, and a lead over Middlesex of 161. Onions gets Durham in a soup - Trevaskis caught behind for three and time to batten down the hatches at 120-5. Five wickets needed for the Jimmy-less attack, just over a session to survive. Whoops! Surrey lose two for nowt. Elgar run-out by David Willey and Ben Foakes bowled by Ben Coad. Surrey 157-4, need 161 to win. So Surrey need 170 more in 35 overs...at just less than five an over. And the Scarborough sun did shine, and the Scarborough wind did blow and it looks like a repeat of last year\u2019s result when Surrey had to chase 228 and made it with seven wickets in hand. Rory Burns top-scored with 97. Cameron Bancroft gets his second fifty in the match for Durham, but Josh Bohannon breaks the 69 run partnership, bowling Graham Clark. Durham, four wickets down, need another 194 to win. Lucky, lucky Sedbergh with this slam-dunkingly beautiful weather. Guildford and Liverpool look over enviously. The pitch was expected to take some turn at Scarborough, but nothing troubling Surrey too much. David Willey grabs the wicket of Borthwick; Yorkshire need to take advantage of Patel\u2019s nerves if they\u2019re going to stop Surrey powering to their second win in a row. Surrey need 169 to win, with eight wickets in hand. Five hundred each at Canterbury too, where Tim Ambrose and Tim Mike are enjoying some afternoon batting practice. Strange goings on at Derby, where both sides notched up 500 in their first innings but Derbyshire are now 69 for four. Nathan Sowter 2 for 22. Here\u2019s one of Saqib\u2019s wicket at Sedbergh from earlier. Durham now 100-3: No Mes, I will not say that Ferguson and Mitchell are looking comfortable against Glamorgan (55-1). And Durham nay-saying at Sedberg, 94 for 3, need 210. Ravi Ashwin\u2019s 35 was the highlight of that sigh to the inevitable at Trent Bridge. Good bowling by Essex all round, with Simon Harmer\u2019s 4-35 taking the bouquets. Post-mortem No.23 for Peter Moores; Essex still in the hunt. Trent Bridge: Essex win by an innings and 23 runs. Nottinghamshire 213 (Mullaney 74) and 183 (Duckett 39, Ashwin 35; Harmer 4-35) v Essex 519-9dec (Browne 163, Bopara 135; Ravi Ashwin 3-162) It\u2019s tricky to know whether this (Derby 34-2) or Notts\u2019 earlier effort wins run out of the round. Run out of the week goes to Fabian Allen and Nicholas Pooran at Chester-le-Street as they advanced on Sri Lanka. Glamorgan have declared and Worcestershire need 326 to win. Joshua Dell is snared lbw by Carey for one. Worcs 22 for one. Somerset captain Tom Abell treads where few dare: \u201cOf course, we can\u2019t avoid thinking about that first ever title because so much is written and spoken about it. But it\u2019s for the supporters and media to get excited. We will continue to look no further ahead than the next game, which is now against Notts next week. If we can win that it will be another important step towards our goal.\u201d I\u2019m not sure the next game will be too much of a problem, Tom. Simon Harmer now has 4-35 as Notts lose Stuart Broad lbw for six. Ravi Ashwin hanging in there, 27 not out. Notts 175 for nine I\u2019m worried about the safety of my chocolate money as the iffy Surrey batting continues thrashing the Yorkies to all parts of Scarborough after lunch. Durham lose another, Burnham to Onions for 20. But Bancroft, who has found his form in the last couple of weeks, still there on 14. Durham 49-3. And cement their place at the top of the table! They pocket 24 points from their sixth win in eight games. Somerset 408 (Hildreth 105; Abbott 6-84) and 353-8dec (Azhar 79 ) v Hampshire 349 (Northeast 101; Jamie Overton 5-70) and 104-9 (Leach 3-14) DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 585-7dec (Dickson 161, Bell-Drummond 166) v Warwickshire 426-6 (Rhodes 109; Sibley 244) Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 213 (Mullaney 74) and 165-8 (Duckett 39; Harmer 3-30) v Essex 519-9dec (Browne 163, Bopara 135; Ravi Ashwin 3-162) Notts trail by 141. Scarborough: Yorkshire 327 (Fraine 106; Clark 5-77) and 352 (S Curran 3-90) v Surrey 362 (Stoneman 100) and 68-0. Surrey need 250 to win. DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 557-6dec (Reece 96, Godleman 102, du Plooy 118) and 10-0 v Middlesex 520 (Malan 199, Simpson 115) Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 449 (Labuschagne 106; Lloyd 97; D\u2019Oliverira 7-92) and 246-5 (Labuschagne 100, D\u2019Oliveira 2-90) v Worcestershire 370 (D\u2019Oliveira 103; Hogan 5-62). Glamorgan lead by 325. Sedbergh: Lancashire 337 (Vilas 72) and 247 (Vilas 85; Rimmington 4-42) v Durham 281 (Bancroft 77; Onions 5-93) and 39-2 (Saqib Mahmood 2-13). Durham need 265 to win. Results Hove: Northants beat Sussex by 393 runs. Northamptonshire 273 (Zaib 54; Robinson 6-63) and 331 (Vasconcelos 88;Robinson 5-69); Sussex 106 (Sanderson 6-37) and 105 ( Brown 46; Sanderson 4-18, Hutton 4-32) Taunton: Somerset beat Hampshire by 313 runs. Somerset 408 (Hildreth 105; Abbott 6-84) and 353-8dec (Azhar 79 ) v Hampshire 349 (Northeast 101; Jamie Overton 5-70) and 104-9 (Leach 3-14) Lunch everywhere except Taunton. Scores to follow. On the one hand, Notts are still batting at lunch. There is no other hand. 161 for 8 - three for Harmer, two for Beard and 19 not out for Ravi Ashwin. Not sure he\u2019s got the measure of the Notts-up yet. And at Taunton, Jack Leach has made a double breakthrough, splitting up the partnership of 57 between Sam Northeast and James Fuller by dismissing Northeast for 23, and in his next over, Keith Barker for four. Hampshire nervously knee-knocking at 93 for six. Lancs aren\u2019t tweeting the wickets from Sedbergh but they\u2019ve described Saqib\u2019s second thus: \u201cSaqib Mahmood is sprinting across the ground after ripping two stumps out of the ground. Gareth Harte is bowled for 0.\u201d Durham 26 for 2. Two sessions and ten minutes to go... Dom Sibley waves his three lions underpants and asks Kevin Pietersen for the number of his tattooist. Now 242, he has equalled his highest previous first-class score. Will he go triple-Daddy? The game could do with some sort of goal. Surrey absolutely flying - 43 for 0 off nine overs, and Yorkshire have already played their best four cards. And a wicket for Mahmood at Sedbergh - Lees for a duck in his first over. Durham 10 for one including seven extras. Interesting little scoop here by Ali: And more Marnus trivia: he is the first Glamorgan player to score two centuries in the same Championship match since Jonathan Hughes in 2005. So... an eight ball duck for Jimmy Anderson. Rimmington 4-42. Durham need 304 to win... a golden opportunity for Saqib Mahmood? Yesterday Joe Leach said of Brett D\u2019Oliveira: \u201cBrett\u2019s innings was probably one of the best I\u2019ve seen in a Worcestershire shirt. It took us from a position where we just avoided the follow on and were staring down the barrel of 150, for us then to start bowling with an 80 run deficit to give us a chance to win the game if we\u2019d bowled a bit better in the last session. Both [batting and bowling]achievements, on their own and together, are outstanding.\u201d And now the boy has two more. Just one more tasty wicket for the ten fer and hundred in a match. Anyone know who the last Worcestershire player to do that was? Oh, Dawid Malan. Caught and bowled for 199 against Derbyshire, the end of a 224 run 7th wicket stand with John Simpson. His highest first-class score but still - the frustration. Middx 480 for seven. Ben Coad 48 not out at Scarborough as Yorkies bowled out for 352, a lead of 317. Tasty little challenge there - the lowest score of the match needed for Surrey to clinch it, but with Maharaj, Olivier and Coad and Surrey\u2019s batsmen a bit iffy.... my (chocolate) money\u2019s on Yorkshire. And Duckett\u2019s gone at Trent Bridge - 110/6 -I can\u2019t keep up. Notts and Hants in a race to destruction and an early lunch. Rossouw joins the party in the pavilion. Hampshire 39 for four. Gregory 2-15, JOverton 2-18. Hey-ho, Labuschagne is out for exactly 100. Glamorgan 164 for 2, a lead of 243. I assume they\u2019ll thrash about for a bit more and then declare? They\u2019ve done very well out of their overseas batsmen over the last two years with Usman Khawaja and then Labuschagne. The power of the daffodil. Marnus Labuschagne! He celebrates becoming the first to 1000 runs with a century against Worcestershire - off just 112 balls. I\u2019d only just clicked that he was Australia\u2019s incumbent Test No.4, Steve Smith\u2019s natural place in the batting order. Interesting to see how it all develops - the Australia v Australia A four-day bun-fight for places will be worth popping into if you\u2019re around. At The Rose Bowl - 23, 24, 25, 26 July An unfortunate early wicket for Hampshire, no sorry make that two: Rahane snaffled by Gregory, and Abbott by JOverton. Hants 18-3 and the day stretches endlessly ahead. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 585-7dec (Dickson 161, Bell-Drummond 166) v Warwickshire 400-3 (Rhodes 109; Sibley 207 not out) Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 213 (Mullaney 74) and 100-5 v Essex519-9dec (Browne 163, Bopara 135; Ravi Ashwin 3-162) Taunton: Somerset 408 (Hildreth 105; Abbott 6-84) and 353-8dec (Azhar 79 ) v Hampshire 349 (Northeast 101; Jamie Overton 5-70) and 12-1 Scarborough: Yorkshire 327 (Fraine 106; Clark 5-77) and 303-9 (S Curran 3-75) v Surrey 362 (Stoneman 100) DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 557-6dec (Reece 96, Godleman 102, du Plooy 118) v Middlesex 436-6 (Malan 177 not out) Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 449 (Labuschagne 106; Lloyd 97; D\u2019Oliverira 7-92) and 137-1 (Labuschagne 90 not out) v Worcestershire 370 (D\u2019Oliveira 103; Hogan 5-62) Sedbergh: Lancashire 337 (Vilas 72) and 204-7 (Vilas 74 not out) v Durham 281 (Bancroft 77; Onions 5-93) Hove: NORTHANTS WIN BY 393 RUNS. Sussex v Northamptonshire 273 (Zaib 54; Robinson 6-63) and 331 (Vasconcelos 88;Robinson 5-69); Sussex 106 (Sanderson 6-37) and 105 ( Brown 46; Sanderson 4-18, Hutton 4-32) And one last thing before I put up the start of play scores - CONGRATULATIONS TO LEICESTERSHIRE\u2019S HASSAN AZAD -a first in engineering! Some good news from Sedbergh. And bad news from Sky, who have decided that they won\u2019t be sharing their World Cup final bounty with free to air, even if England are in it. Also the left size of my mouth is the size of a Christmas Stilton and I can\u2019t have a coffee for an hour. So bear with me. Over at Chester le Street, England have won the toss and are batting. New Zealand are without Lockie Ferguson, out with a tight hamstring. They\u2019re off and the first ball of the day just went for four byes. Follow every over with word composing machine and ultimate OBO guru Rob Smyth . It\u2019s a beautiful start to the day here in Manchester, singing birds and the strawberries red and tubby in the back garden. I\u2019m off to the dentist first thing, though hope to be back in good time for the start of play. Here\u2019s a quick round-up of what went on yesterday: A month away from the Ashes, there was a nasty scare for both England and Lancashire when James Anderson limped off the pitch at Sedbergh clutching his right calf just eight balls into his first spell of the day. He aborted his run-up three times before hobbling off with a hand on his right leg and is set to have a scan to assess the full extent of the damage. He may bat in the remainder of Lancashire\u2019s match against Durham, but won\u2019t bowl. It added to England\u2019s worries on the day they learnt that former Australian captain and galactico Steve Waugh will mentor Australia\u2019s Ashes squad during their tour of England. To rub salt to the wound, Marnus Labuschagne, Glamorgan\u2019s blue riband import, and Australia\u2019s incumbent No.4, became the first to a thousand County Championship runs on the way to an unbeaten 90 against Worcestershire, and his county cap. In the same game at Sophia Gardens, Brett D\u2019Oliveria completed a pinch-yourself couple of days with a century to add to Monday\u2019s seven wicket haul. On the batting paradise at Canterbury, Warwickshire\u2019s Dom Sibley waved his own Ashes flag with an unbeaten double-century against Kent, his fourth first-class hundred of the year. While at Trent Bridge, Ravi Bopara made a stylish hundred as Essex totted up 519 for seven before Notts\u2019 shell-shocked troops limped to 100 for five, still 205 behind. Second-placed Essex will have an eye on victory tomorrow to keep up the pressure on leaders Somerset, who declared on 358 for five at Taunton. Hampshire, chasing 418, were 12 for 1 at the close. Surrey and Yorkshire continued their intriguing battle at Scarborough. Adam Lyth made 63 and Sam Curran took three for 75. Yorkshire go into the last day with a lead of 268 with one wicket remaining. Dane Vilas nurdled a Lancashire recovery from the unpromising position of 0-2, as Chris Rushworth dismissed both Keaton Jennings and Haseeb Hameed for ducks in his first over of the day. Earlier Durham\u2019s tail had collapsed as they lost five wickets for 18 against an Anderson-less Lancashire attack. At Hove, Northants beat Sussex in three days, after Sussex\u2019s batsmen were again filleted, this time, for 105. Ben Sanderson took four for 18 to give him match figures of 10 for 50. The 393 run defeat was Sussex\u2019s worst in Championship cricket. At the County Ground, Dawid Malan clocked up 177 not out, after Middlesex fought back against Derby.",

However, salmonella can be contracted from contact with raw chicken. Brazil\u2019s poultry industry has been a domestic and global success story, employing more than 3.6 million people directly or indirectly. It exports more than 4.3m tonnes of chicken a year all over the world. But the reputation of the Brazilian meat industry has suffered serious damage. A scandal known as Operation Weak Flesh erupted in March 2017: some inspectors in Brazil were alleged to have taken bribes in return for signing off substandard meat, including some contaminated with salmonella.

Much of the contaminated meat was detained by port inspection staff before being sent back to Brazil, according to FSA records obtained by a FOI request. But records show that in some cases dirty meat had already been allowed into the UK, forcing the authorities to seek a recall. Our investigation has established that significant quantities of the Brazilian dirty chicken detected at UK ports since April 2017 were supplied by two of the country\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) biggest meat companies, JBS and BRF, or their subsidiaries. An analysis of internal documents obtained from the FSA and international shipping records reveal how the companies between them shipped at least 400 tonnes of contaminated chicken to the UK over 20 months. The number of contaminated shipments sent by BRF fell significantly in 2018, possibly in part because a number of company plants have been blacklisted by the EU. Earlier this year however, BRF was forced to recall almost 500 tonnes of chicken products suspected of being contaminated with salmonella. Some JBS meat exported to the UK was found to harbour salmonella as recently as November 2018, according to records seen by the Guardian. JBS said that none of the revelations of Operation Weak Flesh \u201ccalled into question the quality standard of its products\u201d. It stressed that it follows all the standards and procedures laid down by the European Commission for its exports to the EU. BRF said it \u201cmeets the legal standard and quality requirements of all customers and countries where it operates and to which it exports, and bases its actions on the security commitments, quality and integrity\u201d.",
