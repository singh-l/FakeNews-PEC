China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cConsidering previous violations by troops, including excessive use of force against protesters, and the lack of accountability despite allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings, we hope that the government will ask security forces to be rights-respecting,\u201d said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch.</p> \n<p>One man, who asked not to be named, said he was travelling back to Srinagar from Delhi on Tuesday, because he was concerned about his family.

Its abrupt and ruthless manner, with the house arrest of well-known politicians, imposition of a curfew and blackout of the internet and phone lines, will likely lead to protests and inflame the resentment which has underpinned an insurgency which has cost tens of thousands of lives. Though it has ebbed since its horrific peak two decades ago, the violence has crept up again more recently: 2018 was the bloodiest year for a decade. In February, Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed killed more than 40 soldiers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/indian-paramilitaries-killed-in-suicide-car-bombing-in-kashmir\" title=\"\">in a suicide car bombing</a> \u2013 the deadliest attack on Indian forces there for decades. The youth of the population, in many cases too young to remember the full cost of the conflict in the 1990s, gives cause for worry.</p> <p>The broader reverberations in an unstable region are as worrying. Pakistan has already condemned New Delhi\u2019s move and said it will \u201cgo to any extent\u201d to protect Kashmiris. The two nuclear-armed neighbours have long been at odds \u2013 and at times at war \u2013 over the disputed Himalayan region; Bill Clinton once described the ceasefire line as the most dangerous place in the world. China, which also has a territorial dispute, declared India\u2019s actions unacceptable and void. The US has been critical in defusing previous crises in the past. But it is harder to place faith in the Trump administration \u2013 and Washington is unlikely to be overly interested in the plight of Kashmiris unless the regional peace looks threatened. </p> <p>Seven decades ago, independence and partition posed Kashmir the choice between two nations. When its ruler agreed to accede to India, New Delhi guaranteed it autonomy except in matters such as foreign affairs and defence. In reality, that has been eroded over the years. A violent insurgency, partly fuelled by Pakistan, was brutally repressed with severe human rights violations. The scrapping of article 370 is in large part symbolic \u2013 but nonetheless hazardous for that. Lifting restraints on the purchase of land and permanent settlement by outsiders is almost as inflammatory: many fear a consequent demographic shift.</p> <p>India\u2019s secularists saw Kashmir\u2019s status as the proof of India\u2019s strength as a multifaith nation. But May\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/india-election-results-narendra-modi-bjp-victory\" title=\"\">second landslide victory</a> for the BJP has given Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in power since 2014, free rein to realise his Hindu nationalist vision.

They say these changes will support progress and development in Kashmir. It has already earned the applause of the Hindu heartlands.</p> <p>In recent years, many Kashmiris have rejected separatism and the majority have placed their faith in mainstream politics. Yet Delhi has cut off communications, locked down the region and put politicians under house arrest. The consequences are likely to be grave.</p>",

Pakistan has already condemned New Delhi\u2019s move and said it will \u201cgo to any extent\u201d to protect Kashmiris. The two nuclear-armed neighbours have long been at odds \u2013 and at times at war \u2013 over the disputed Himalayan region; Bill Clinton once described the ceasefire line as the most dangerous place in the world. China, which also has a territorial dispute, declared India\u2019s actions unacceptable and void. The US has been critical in defusing previous crises in the past. But it is harder to place faith in the Trump administration \u2013 and Washington is unlikely to be overly interested in the plight of Kashmiris unless the regional peace looks threatened. Seven decades ago, independence and partition posed Kashmir the choice between two nations. When its ruler agreed to accede to India, New Delhi guaranteed it autonomy except in matters such as foreign affairs and defence. In reality, that has been eroded over the years. A violent insurgency, partly fuelled by Pakistan, was brutally repressed with severe human rights violations. The scrapping of article 370 is in large part symbolic \u2013 but nonetheless hazardous for that. Lifting restraints on the purchase of land and permanent settlement by outsiders is almost as inflammatory: many fear a consequent demographic shift. India\u2019s secularists saw Kashmir\u2019s status as the proof of India\u2019s strength as a multifaith nation. But May\u2019s second landslide victory for the BJP has given Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in power since 2014, free rein to realise his Hindu nationalist vision. Some experts think Donald Trump\u2019s offer to mediate in the dispute with Pakistan and progress in Afghanistan peace talks may have also played a part. Mr Modi and his allies understand how provocative this move is: why else impose this lockdown? They say these changes will support progress and development in Kashmir. It has already earned the applause of the Hindu heartlands. In recent years, many Kashmiris have rejected separatism and the majority have placed their faith in mainstream politics. Yet Delhi has cut off communications, locked down the region and put politicians under house arrest. The consequences are likely to be grave.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Concerns had mounted over the last week as a series of government orders leaked to the media began to provoke panic. One told Indian Railways staff in the Kashmir valley to stock enough dry rations to last four months and forecast a \u201cdeteriorating situation\u201d. An extra 10,000 troops were sent to the already heavily militarised territory, prompting fears Delhi might be about to remove Kashmir\u2019s special status.</p> \n<p>Rumours intensified further when, in an unprecedented move, the government curtailed a Hindu pilgrimage to a Himalayan cave shrine \u2013 a 45-day trek that about 300,000 people had embarked upon since July. Pilgrims and tourists rushed to the airport and several governments, including Britain\u2019s, warned against all travel to Jammu and Kashmir.</p> \n<p>The Indian government cited security risks and said it had found evidence of attacks planned on pilgrim routes, but analysts questioned whether the action had been proportionate. Curfews and evacuations continued to be imposed on hospitals and educational institutions in Kashmir over the weekend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ca8838fb-ebec-498c-a2c2-1dd688573ef2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Governments around the world have used internet blackouts, or blocked popular platforms such as WhatsApp, at times of political crisis.

      "bodyText": "When Gauhar Siraj woke on Monday, he realised something was about to happen. He\u2019d travelled to Kashmir for a wedding, and tension had been building all week. Then in the morning: \u201cBam, there\u2019s a curfew, internet is cut, telephone lines are snapped, you can\u2019t make any kind of communication,\u201d he says. Outside, access to main roads in Srinagar, the largest city in Indian-administered Kashmir, had been blocked. Hours later, the Indian government announced the most radical change any government has suggested for Kashmir since the region joined the Indian union. It would revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status and divide the state in two. The move immediately angered Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir, and provoked warnings from China, which holds a thinly populated area in the disputed region. In Kashmir, people watched the news unfold on TV, the only source of information, and began to meet on the streets in residential areas, where some movement was still allowed. \u201cBecause the internet was down, telephones were down, so people congregated in small groups everywhere within the residential areas \u2026 There was this apprehension that things are going to get worse because this is what India does,\u201d said Siraj, who spoke to the Guardian after flying to Delhi on Monday night. Concerns had mounted over the last week as a series of government orders leaked to the media began to provoke panic. One told Indian Railways staff in the Kashmir valley to stock enough dry rations to last four months and forecast a \u201cdeteriorating situation\u201d. An extra 10,000 troops were sent to the already heavily militarised territory, prompting fears Delhi might be about to remove Kashmir\u2019s special status. Rumours intensified further when, in an unprecedented move, the government curtailed a Hindu pilgrimage to a Himalayan cave shrine \u2013 a 45-day trek that about 300,000 people had embarked upon since July. Pilgrims and tourists rushed to the airport and several governments, including Britain\u2019s, warned against all travel to Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian government cited security risks and said it had found evidence of attacks planned on pilgrim routes, but analysts questioned whether the action had been proportionate. Curfews and evacuations continued to be imposed on hospitals and educational institutions in Kashmir over the weekend. Prominent political leaders met to raise concerns over the possibility that Delhi might be preparing to remove Kashmir\u2019s autonomy. Hours before the Indian home affairs minister, Amit Shah, addressed parliament, the leaders were placed under house arrest. The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has repeatedly promised to end Kashmir\u2019s special status, and, after the prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s landslide victory in the May elections, the party had control of the lower house of parliament, where it was predicted the proposals would be passed. The scrapping of special status has long been a demand of the BJP\u2019s Hindu nationalist support base. Analysts say Delhi may be attempting to assert itself regionally, as Pakistan gains favour with the US, which is seeking Islamabad\u2019s cooperation in furthering a peace deal in Afghanistan. Siraj said some were banking on Trump to intervene, or for a case to be brought to the international court of justice. People believe things will get worse but they are not afraid, he said. \u201cThings have changed. The next generation of Kashmiris, they are different, they don\u2019t take anything lying down,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir fear even of death has significantly lessened.\u201d",
