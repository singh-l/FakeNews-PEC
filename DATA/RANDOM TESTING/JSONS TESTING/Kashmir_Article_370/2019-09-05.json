Written by the Gold Walkley winning investigative reporter Kate McClymont, the piece was based on interviews with 14 neurosurgeons and related specialists as well as former Teo patients. The article detailed allegations of what it called \u201cinappropriate conduct in the operating theatre\u201d by Teo, and referred to a 1996 sexual harassment case filed against Teo by a nurse working in the Arkansas children\u2019s hospital in the US. The article quoted Teo\u2019s comments from a 2008 book in which he said the case was dropped and the incident wiped from his record \u201conly after he got letters of support from a senator and an oil magnate who were his patients, and from Bill Clinton\u2019s personal physician\u201d.
