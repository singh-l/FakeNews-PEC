Despite being the world's riskiest place \u2013 with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake \u2013 it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we'll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crown</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>These rooms are well lived in, recognisable and human, making it all the more unsettling that death can reach inside \u2013 sometimes without anyone outside noticing.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor the family of the <em>kodok</em><em>ushi</em>, it would be a huge shock to accept that the body was left undiscovered for so long. How often do people call their aged father or mother who lives alone?

In one case the owner was the victim of a stalker, and became too scared to go out to clear up the trash.\u201d</p> \n<p>Again, it is all about the details: tiny Krispy Kreme boxes, tiny plastic bottles, tiny cockroaches.

The rest I made with resin.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yuji Masuda, her boss, encourages her to work on the models while at the office, and some of the other 13 staff have started pitching in. Masuda founded the company 18 years after he found his next-door neighbour dead at her house.

      "body": "<p>Cameroon, a central African state of 24 million people on the Gulf of Guinea, is rarely in the news \u2013 which is surprising, given the awful things happening there. In a warring world full of conflict, the country\u2019s troubles barely rate a mention. That\u2019s short-sighted. As Yemen shows, today\u2019s local difficulties have a habit of becoming tomorrow\u2019s international crises.</p> <p>Long-running tensions between Cameroon\u2019s French and English-speaking communities came to a head last week with the arrest of at least 350 members of the main opposition party, whose leader has been jailed since January. Human Rights Watch accused security forces of using <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/06/04/mass-arrests-opposition-members-cameroon\" title=\"\">\u201cexcessive and indiscriminate force\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Political repression may be the least of Cameroon\u2019s worries.

Since 2016, conflict between government forces and non-state armed groups has forced 450,000 people from their homes.</p> <p>According to the report, \u201c780,000 children are out of school. Hundreds of villages have been burned down, tens of thousands of people are hiding in the bush with no humanitarian support, and attacks are taking place every day.\u201d Both the government and separatists are accused of \u201chorrific human rights violations\u201d.</p> <p>Though the specifics vary, Cameroon does not suffer in isolation. Its instability reflects that of its neighbours \u2013 Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic \u2013 and the wider Sahel region.

      "bodyText": "Cameroon, a central African state of 24 million people on the Gulf of Guinea, is rarely in the news \u2013 which is surprising, given the awful things happening there. In a warring world full of conflict, the country\u2019s troubles barely rate a mention. That\u2019s short-sighted. As Yemen shows, today\u2019s local difficulties have a habit of becoming tomorrow\u2019s international crises. Long-running tensions between Cameroon\u2019s French and English-speaking communities came to a head last week with the arrest of at least 350 members of the main opposition party, whose leader has been jailed since January. Human Rights Watch accused security forces of using \u201cexcessive and indiscriminate force\u201d. Political repression may be the least of Cameroon\u2019s worries. According to a new Norwegian Refugee Council report, Cameroon is the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis. Since 2016, conflict between government forces and non-state armed groups has forced 450,000 people from their homes. According to the report, \u201c780,000 children are out of school. Hundreds of villages have been burned down, tens of thousands of people are hiding in the bush with no humanitarian support, and attacks are taking place every day.\u201d Both the government and separatists are accused of \u201chorrific human rights violations\u201d. Though the specifics vary, Cameroon does not suffer in isolation. Its instability reflects that of its neighbours \u2013 Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic \u2013 and the wider Sahel region. Across this vast area, home to numerous other under-reported conflicts, the developed world\u2019s present-day neglect is sowing a poisonous future harvest. In Nigeria, the notorious Boko Haram insurgency has been pegged back. But the rise of less-known Isis affiliates, such as so-called Islamic State West Africa, and regional jihadist groups is a cause of growing concern, says the US-based Council on Foreign Relations. About 2.4 million people in the Lake Chad basin are displaced. \u201cAlthough the Nigerian military has regained control in parts of the north-east, civilians in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger continue to be affected by grave violations of human rights, widespread sexual and gender-based violence, forced recruitment and suicide bombings,\u201d the UN\u2019s refugee agency says. Investigations by the New Humanitarian project suggest the Sahel emergency is intensifying rapidly. \u201cA surge in violence in recent months in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left more than 440,000 people displaced and 5,000 dead as militants \u2013 some with links to al-Qaida and Isis \u2013 extend their grip across the region,\u201d it reported in May. The ramifications of this advance are dire. \u201cAs they gain ground, the jihadists are stoking conflicts between different ethnic groups \u2026 putting the region\u2019s entire social fabric into question. Cycles of inter-communal violence are now claiming more lives and uprooting more people than direct jihadist attacks,\u201d New Humanitarian says. Neglected or forgotten conflicts are by no means confined to sub-Saharan Africa. Nor are political, ethnic or religious tensions the only factors. Conflicts are often rooted in the failure of authoritarian, incompetent or corrupt governments to protect their citizens, as in Sudan. Struggling communities may fear state security forces more than they fear local militias, as in Kashmir. Yet the inattention of wealthy countries, coupled with the damaging impact of their economic and cultural behaviour, are powerful factors, too. Interventionism, and escalation of local conflicts by the co-opting of proxy forces, are on the rise, as seen in Libya where rival states back opposing sides. At the same time, external diplomatic mediation and third-party peace efforts are declining even as the total number of conflicts rises, according to Oslo\u2019s Peace Research Institute. The western world has long fixated, for example, on the Israel-Palestine peace process. By contrast, no comparable commitment is seen in Somalia, ravaged by decades of conflict. Aggravating this neglect are inadequate, under-fire western foreign aid and assistance budgets. UN humanitarian appeals are routinely under-funded. Aid can become a political football, as happened recently in Venezuela. Meanwhile, environmental degradation linked to the climate crisis is increasing poverty and inequality, helping to drive conflict. Climate change, specifically drought, played a key role in sparking the Darfur genocide in the early 2000s, where farmers were pitted against herders. It is a factor now in Iraq, Egypt and other areas of the Middle East where competition for ever scarcer water supplies is intensifying. It is a factor, too, in a resurgence of preventable diseases, as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The link to conflict is evident. \u201cEnvironmental degradation is starting to reverberate and affect economic growth,\u201d a Brookings Institution study of sustainability declared last month: \u201cDisasters triggered by weather and climate-related hazards were responsible for thousands of deaths and $320bn in losses in 2017 \u2026 Water stress linked to climate change is already contributing to migration, which in turn can lead to conflict.\u201d According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, political violence and protest surged worldwide last year. \u201cThese trends showed few signs of stopping in 2019,\u201d it says.
