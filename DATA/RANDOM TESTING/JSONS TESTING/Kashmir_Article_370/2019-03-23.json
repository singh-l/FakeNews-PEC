For what appear to me impenetrable reasons, your government has stubbornly ploughed a single furrow to get us here. And yet, after two of the most resounding parliamentary defeats in all history, and with clear evidence the country as a whole no longer supports Brexit, you still appear determined to resist any change of course. I can only conclude that you have forgotten the office of prime minister is one of service to the people. Not some imaginary people living in a different Britain three years ago, but the real people here now. Many of whom are marching in London today. You have claimed that only Brexit can heal the divide in our society now. Brexit can never heal the divide, when those who most aggressively promoting are a principal cause of it.

Ken Clarke is right that referenda are generally a bad idea, especially when concerned with complicated matters. It is clear that people voted leave for a number of reasons and any alternatives are numerous and disparate. Failure to set a proper margin for victory or ask anything beyond a binary question in the referendum has left the country deeply divided. Despite this, you seem to have decided that you alone know what those 17 million people voted for. A cross-party approach to Brexit was the chance to heal the divisions yet you have failed to properly consult and collaborate with parliament in a timely fashion. This has led to the country facing a Hobson\u2019s choice of your deal or no deal. We live in a parliamentary democracy yet both these outcomes have been rejected by parliament.

Seasoned observers read this as a variation on \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d and \u201cafter the fog of Brexit clears\u201d. These have been the Scottish National party leader\u2019s other favoured formulations as she maintains a challenging balance between the agitation of many party activists and some parliamentarians who want her to act now and her own understanding of the country\u2019s mood. <br></p> \n  <p>Polling continues to suggest that the public are not keen on a second independence referendum within five years, while Brexit has failed to push support for leaving the UK up to the convincing margin of around 60% that insiders believe is critical for a second poll to succeed.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon\u2019s presence at the rally is significant though. Her party swung behind a second Brexit referendum late last year, despite the fact that a significant minority of SNP voters supported leave in 2016. Many still hold reservations that a second EU referendum may set an unhelpful precedent for a second independence vote, but throughout the Brexit process Sturgeon has emphasised the SNP\u2019s willingness to work across the parties to reach a workable consensus.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-03-23T10:56:03.452Z\">at 10.56am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5c960ccbe4b0e8eadf782d57\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-03-23T10:42:24.049Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dansabbagh/status/1109038765920714752\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Are you going on the People's Vote march tomorrow?

Deputy Leader of the Labour party Tom Watson told the crowds in Parliament Square: \u201cTheresa May: you don\u2019t speak for us.\u201d Dan Sabbagh rounds up some of his favourite placards from this afternoon\u2019s march. Addressing the crowd Anna Soubry of The Independent Group, Conservatives Justine Greening and Philip Lee, Green Caroline Lucas, the Lib Dem\u2019s Jo Swinson, the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford and Labour\u2019s David Lammy and Rosena Alin Khan took it in turns to criticise the Brexit process. Ms Soubry urged her parliamentary colleagues to \u201cput your country first, get into the lobbies and vote for a People\u2019s vote\u201d. Mr Blackford said: \u201cNo parliamentarians should be going through the lobbies to make their constituents poorer.\u201d The campaign group @ByDonkeys who have been posting the Tweets of prominent politicians in the run-up to the referendum on billboards around the country unfurled a banner with a Tweet from Brexiteer David Davis in which he said: \u201cIf a democracy cannot change, it ceases to be a democracy.\u201d Writer Caitlin Moran shared an image of her placard on Instagram Following his speech, deputy Labour leader Mr Watson tweeted: \u201cThe Prime Minister claims she speaks for Britain. \u201cWell, have a look out of the window, Prime Minister. Open your curtains. Switch on your TV. Look at this great crowd today. Here are the people. \u201cTheresa May: you don\u2019t speak for us. PutItToThePeople.\u201d Lara has come from France to show her support for Britain remaining in the EU. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, urged people to secure a longer extension to the process, to allow time for a new referendum to be held. \u201cThis is now the moment of maximum opportunity \u2013 we need to avoid both the catastrophe of no-deal and the damage which would be caused by the prime minister\u2019s bad deal. The EU\u2019s decision to postpone things until at least April 12 has opened a window, and those of us who oppose Brexit must seize the chance it offers.\u201d Sturgeon said the House of Commons must take back control from Theresa May and \u201csecure a longer extension to the process, to allow time for a new referendum to be held\u201d. \u201cThe prime minister and her government have proved completely incapable of delivering on the result of the 2016 vote, which is why it is right that this should now go back to the people.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon tweeted a photo from the Put it to the People march where she addressed crowds in Parliament Square. The Scottish First Minister wrote: \u201cMassive crowds at Put It to the People rally in London today. Good to be there.\u201d The deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, has called for a people\u2019s vote to reunite the country and decide the future together. He joined other political leaders marching through London before taking to the stage in Parliament Square. \u201cThe prime minister claims she speaks for Britain. Well, have a look out of the window prime minister. Open your curtains. Switch on your TV. Look at this great crowd today. Here are the people. Theresa May: you don\u2019t speak for us.\u201d He said Labour efforts to \u201cput aside party differences\u201d to broker a better deal that could satisfy both leavers and remainers had failed. \u201cAt every turn we have been ignored. At every stage Theresa May has doubled down rather than reaching out. She has made it impossible for anyone who cares about jobs, about solidarity at home and abroad, about friendship across borders and between communities to support this Brexit.\u201d Watson finished his speech by saying that the only way to solve the crisis was to recognise that \u201cwe\u2019re all in it together\u201d. He said: \u201cThe way to break the stalemate is for parliament and the people to come together. The way to reunite our country is to decide on our future together. It\u2019s time to say with one voice: put it to the people. Prime minister, you have lost control. Let the people take back control.\u201d A couple who flew over from Berlin were at the march today. Organisers of the march said it \u201cexceeded all expectations\u201d, with a turnout of around 1 million, making it one of the biggest protests in British history. Those behind the march for a second vote on Brexit said the size of the crowd spilling into Hyde Park and side streets was much bigger than that during the last People\u2019s Vote march on 20 October. A spokesperson for the campaign said: \u201cIt is almost impossible to put an exact figure on the size of this immense crowd because it is spilling out across central London. The start of the march at Park Lane has been filled to bursting point and many thousands of people are trying to make their way to Parliament Square through side streets.\u201d They added: \u201cAt the time the rally began, people were still arriving in Park Lane. Our estimate is based on professional expert advice and whatever the exact number, there can be no doubt that this ranks as one of the greatest protests \u2013 possibly the biggest ever \u2013 that this country has ever seen. We have no doubt that this march is bigger than the last with our early estimate putting the size of the crowd at around 1 million.\u201d Our reporter, Gareth Rubin, has been out on the march today, talking to people and asking for their views on Brexit. \u2018I\u2019m so disappointed with how divisive everyone\u2019s become\u2019 Instead of just whinging about it, we felt like we needed to make ourselves heard. It\u2019s more important for our children than ourselves \u2013 about their careers and the state of the country in the future. I\u2019m fed up with hearing Theresa May talk about the numbers who voted to leave, when it was such a small majority. She can stop going on about \u2018the will of the people\u2019 \u2013 the will of the people is not all one way. For me, the EU means peace and prosperity: it\u2019s being a part of something bigger, not fighting each other. I\u2019m so disappointed with how divisive everyone\u2019s become, attacking each other. I\u2019m the daughter of an immigrant from India and I feel even more that we should be open and tolerant and working together. Our country is full of immigrants and it\u2019s always been based on that. To suddenly become so anti, that just isn\u2019t British to me \u2013 Lucy Reeves, 45, market researcher, with her husband, Steve, 45, and daughters Mia, 10, and Lily, 12. \u2018I\u2019m angry about what has happened and that the parties can\u2019t put aside their party politics\u2019 In 2016 I campaigned to remain. Unfortunately, we lost so now I\u2019m doing all I can to get us the best deal possible on leaving \u2013 or, if possible, have a second referendum. I think today will definitely be a success in terms of alerting the government to how many people care about this issue. So many people have been disenfranchised in this process and we want our voices to be heard as part of the negotiations. If nothing else, I think the march will definitely have an impact on opening the politicians\u2019 eyes. I am angry about what\u2019s happened and I\u2019m angry that the parties can\u2019t put aside their party politics and listen to what people have to say. This is the true voice of the people and they have to listen to that. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to me to be here \u2013 Suhail Dhanji, secondary school teacher, 23. \u2018We have to stop this or it will be disastrous for our country, our children and out future\u2019 Brexit is disastrous for our country. I\u2019ve never been on a march since 1962, when I marched out of the army, but I felt very strongly that I had to come here today. This is a fantastic march \u2013 unbelievable numbers. I\u2019m in favour of trying to work together rather than in opposition because the world is in a very dangerous situation and leaving Europe just fragments it further \u2013 that leads to disastrous politics. So I hope \u2013 though I doubt \u2013 that Theresa May will listen to this huge objection to her strategy. So much has come out since we voted, and so many more people now are aware what the issues are, about being dragged out \u2013 the collapse of our car manufacturing industry, banks going everywhere and anyone with any money is getting it out of the UK. We have to stop this or it will be disastrous for our country, our children and our future \u2013 David Frost, 80, former military police officer. \u2018If Theresa May can have a vote a number of times on the same thing, why can\u2019t we?\u2019 I\u2019m from Ireland but I\u2019m at university in Glasgow and as a person who will still be in the EU even after Britain leaves, I think it\u2019s important to have connections with the country I live in. I\u2019m lucky that because of the Good Friday agreement I won\u2019t have to apply for settled status after Brexit but I have friends from other European countries who don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. For me, the European Union means the freedom to move around, we can cooperate \u2013 as scientists we can share research and join forces. It\u2019s better to work together. It\u2019s important for people like me to be able to study in the UK and I hope today will mean those of us asking for a second referendum won\u2019t just be pushed aside. It\u2019s the best option. If Theresa May can have a vote a number of times on the same thing, why can\u2019t we? \u2013 Tara Duggan, 19, studying electronics with music The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said Theresa May\u2019s \u201cchaotic and confused approach\u201d has led to failure and there is no other choice but to vote again on Brexit. Speaking at the march, he said the clock had run down. \u201cThere is no time left for further negotiations. And the prime minister has wasted the good will of our European neighbours with her chaotic and confused approach. Those who wanted to help us secure a good deal for both sides now just want the process to end.\u201d He said Britons were already paying the price for May\u2019s failure. \u201cThe uncertainty she has deliberately created as she puts her party before her country has come at a cost. Business investment has fallen and almost every week another major manufacturer warns they are reducing production in Britain.\u201d Khan said the choices left on the table were \u201cappalling\u201d: May\u2019s deal which would \u201cdestroy opportunities for the next generation\u201d or \u201ca catastrophic no-deal Brexit\u201d. He said the latter option would cause nothing short of a major national emergency. \u201cSome say a fresh public vote will cause further division. I disagree \u2013 it is the opportunity we desperately need to heal the divisions that have only widened since the referendum,\u201d he said. Some of the best signs from the march today. The Independent Group tweeted a video of their MP Anna Soubry on the march, cheering when the organisers claimed that 1 million people were in attendance. Alongside the video posted on the parliamentary group\u2019s official Twitter account, they wrote: \u201cWe\u2019ve just heard how many people have come along to the PutItToThePeople march in London today! \u201cIncredible support from people along the route too. Thank you. ChangePolitics.\u201d Sophia Khan emailed to say that her family were unable to make it to the march today, but her 10-year-old daughter sent the following message to No 10: Dear prime minister, I may only be ten, but I\u2019m still worried about the UK\u2019s future. Leaving the EU with your deal will not work. Leaving the EU with no deal will not work. Leaving the EU with a hard Brexit will not work. Leaving the EU will not work!! If Brexit happens, it\u2019ll affect my future, and all other young people\u2019s future badly. It\u2019ll affect living standards, costs of living, jobs, my rights as a citizen, prices, etc. Again, I\u2019m not an adult, but I can still have an opinion. Schools and hospitals won\u2019t have enough resources, and they don\u2019t even have many now! I am currently homeschooled, but I used to go to a school that was very low on resources anyway. I want a people\u2019s vote. Give the decision back to the people. If nobody wanted a people\u2019s vote, why are there millions of people marching on your doorstep at this very moment? This is unfair. We want to have a choice on what happens with the country. This is our country too, we have an opinion. Rally hosts Mariella Frostrup and Richard Bacon have taken to the stage in Parliament Square. They claim that an initial count of demonstrators shows that the estimated number of people taking part in the march has topped 1 million. Estimates are in for the numbers who are out on the streets today: 1 million people. Ronan McLaverty-Head, a teacher, shared this message with us: As a teacher I have been advising my students for years to consider studying in Europe. Brexit blows a hole in that opportunity. My own son was offered a place to study at the prestigious Leiden University in Holland for September but had to decline as no one could say what tuition fees he would be paying either in the event of no deal or after any transition. This is why the march is so important: among many other problems, Brexit takes opportunities away from young Britons and makes them second class members of their own continent (unless they are lucky enough to be able to get an Irish passport). Here is his tweet on the subject: After one reader said they\u2019d written to No 10, we have had a few others sharing their messages to the prime minister: I took your contributor\u2019s suggestion and used the Number 10 Contact form to send a message direct to Theresa May. Thanks for sharing this suggestion! Here is my message: Almost three years since a deeply flawed advisory referendum, won by the narrowest of margins, and with absolutely no clear single interpretation of the outcome, the country is almost at the point of a no-deal crash. For what appear to me impenetrable reasons, your government has stubbornly ploughed a single furrow to get us here. And yet, after two of the most resounding parliamentary defeats in all history, and with clear evidence the country as a whole no longer supports Brexit, you still appear determined to resist any change of course. I can only conclude that you have forgotten the office of prime minister is one of service to the people. Not some imaginary people living in a different Britain three years ago, but the real people here now. Many of whom are marching in London today. You have claimed that only Brexit can heal the divide in our society now. Brexit can never heal the divide, when those who most aggressively promoting are a principal cause of it. Revoke article 50 now! An aerial shot of those walking through the streets of London on Saturday. Large screens dotted along Whitehall are explaining how people can text and tweet their support for the Put it to the People march as music plays across the square where thousands have gathered. On a small stage on Whitehall, a group of people are singing songs reworded with anti-Brexit lyrics. Meanwhile, speakers are gathering behind a large stage on Parliament Square where MPs and celebrities are expected to address the crowd. Ian Robertson, who is marching today, emailed to say: I have made it to Parliament Square. I am not going to let my stage four cancer prevent me from fighting the madness overtaking our country. More people are also sharing support from abroad, with Ignaty Dyakov, saying: [I] Can\u2019t be at #PeoplesVoteMarch in London in person to say #notobrexit and demand #RevokeArticle50 so joining in in spirit from the Himalayas to support the cause. From that high up it is especially clear that we can help our wonderful world in crisis only by being together - including Britain and other European countries. More people from abroad showing support for the march. Anne Hopkins emailed to say: \u201cSo disappointed to be in Australia and not marching as I did in October. Following helicopter coverage all through the night.\u201d And in Britain, Sandra Lovell, 79, takes her grandchildren Agnes, 11, and Wilfred, nine, with her to walk in London. Sadiq Khan tweeted a video of the countdown launching the Put it to the People march, as he held up a banner at the front of demonstrators. Matt Sears sent a message to the Guardian saying he cannot attend the march but wants his voice to be heard so he has used the number 10 contact form and encourages others to do the same. Here is his message: I cannot march but I am writing to express my dismay at the position our country is now in and to ask you to do something about it. Ken Clarke is right that referenda are generally a bad idea, especially when concerned with complicated matters. It is clear that people voted leave for a number of reasons and any alternatives are numerous and disparate. Failure to set a proper margin for victory or ask anything beyond a binary question in the referendum has left the country deeply divided. Despite this, you seem to have decided that you alone know what those 17 million people voted for. A cross-party approach to Brexit was the chance to heal the divisions yet you have failed to properly consult and collaborate with parliament in a timely fashion. This has led to the country facing a Hobson\u2019s choice of your deal or no deal. We live in a parliamentary democracy yet both these outcomes have been rejected by parliament. I urge you to respect democracy, change position and avert disaster. Thank you. A lot of you have been tweeting me to share your thoughts. Here is a selection on why people are marching or wish they could. The EU citizens who are still in limbo said they were \u201cmarching today to fight for the future of the country they call home\u201d. Elena Remigi, the founder of the In Limbo Project, together with her husband Alessandro, Beate Metz, Thomas Heynes and many other members told the Guardian they were ready to stand up and fight. Leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Vince Cable has tweeted his support for a second referendum after launching the Put it to the People march in central London. Dan Sabbagh is updating from the march, reporting on the speeches made by a group of leftwing politicians, unions and campaigners, who have come together to launch a united Left Bloc group. Thousands of people have begun marching through central London to demand the public get a final say on Brexit. The march began at midday as demonstrators started from Hyde Park Corner towards Parliament Square. Large EU flags are being flown by people throughout the crowd. Marching bands, whistles and cheers are providing a constant backdrop of noise. People are being led in chants for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d. Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn is hundreds of miles away in Morecambe, where he will be speaking at a local election campaign A message spotted from a ski-lift connecting Meribel to Val Thorens in France: Transport for London has issued a note about the routing of the demonstration. Melanie Perry sent a photo in of her two children who are marching today. Otis is 11 and Cole is 9. Perry, aged 50, is marching alongside her husband Tom, 43. She said: My husband and I are marching because this is a historic moment and we want to be able to say we played our part no matter what the outcome. It is a chance for us to get out of our bubble down here and show the kids that the world is bigger and it is important to make a stand for what you believe in. Our eldest son has just started to be aware of politics and what it means and this is a great opportunity for him to see and hear the views of the speakers today. He was keen to be involved especially since finding out some of his friends are also going. Our youngest son is fascinated by the sound of a \u2018march\u2019 and wondered if it would be violent but we assured him it will be a peaceful protest. A Tweet by @UKLabour asking for canvassing help on the doorstep today has sparked thousands of outraged responses from people frustrated at Labour\u2019s Brexit position. Dan Sabbagh tweets this about Caroline Lucas: We talked to different people from around the UK about why they are marching. Naomi Thompson, 36, from Devon I\u2019m marching because when this is all over, I want a clean conscience, to know I have done everything I could to stop Brexit. Oh, and I want good stories to tell my grandchildren. Assuming we all survive. Delia Smith, 77, Suffolk (yes, that Delia Smith) During the referendum, people were just given two options on a ballot paper and I think they were stuck. There were promises over the NHS. Now we have had time to think it through and it\u2019s so clear that leaving will be awful. Read some more from them and others in the article: The online petition calling for the government to cancel Brexit has now reached more than 4,150,000 signatures and has become the most popular to be submitted to the parliament website. The Revoke Article 50 petition on Saturday leapt ahead of a 2016 petition, which also called for a second EU referendum. The Guardian has received lots of emails and messages about why people are marching today, and even messages of solidarity from those who can\u2019t make it. Steve Clark and Kim Taylor sent over a photo and a picture, saying: \u201cWe proudly went up to London on the last march, but we booked a holiday in Vietnam this time around. We are avidly following the Guardian newsfeeds and are there in spirit! Good luck and thanks!\u201d A similar message came through on Twitter: Bethan Tichborne said there were so many people travelling from Oxford to London that there were \u201cqueues of around a hundred people at some stops and the coaches are going past later stops without picking anyone up\u201d. Natasha Walter sent over some photographs of her children\u2019s banners. Four coaches, each carrying 50 passengers, are travelling from Scotland to London for the march, with many more people making their own way. The assembly point for Scottish protesters is at the Achilles statue in the south-east corner of Hyde Park, with organisers telling people to look out for Saltires and tartan. All four coaches sold out quickly, with waiting lists operating, and a crowdfunder raised more than \u00a34,000 to help subsidise travel. The European Movement in Scotland held a rally in Festival Square on Friday night to send off the marchers. Coaches picked up people from Perth, Stirling and Gretna, with some marchers travelling from as far afield as Orkney and Stornoway on the Western Isles. An interesting proposal for what to do in case of a hard Brexit has appeared in Marble Arch, London. British in Europe, representing UK citizens settled in the rest of the EU, have been flying in for the march in the past 24 hours. Their frustration is that they have become bargaining chips and couldn\u2019t vote in the referendum. Some more images from people taking part in the march, posted on Twitter. Michael O\u2019Carroll from Swansea said there are almost three times as many people on coaches from the Welsh city as there were for the last people\u2019s vote march in October. Peter Corr emailed the Guardian to say: \u201cI am on a train to London surrounded by people dressed in blue and gold with an array of placards and banners. It is standing room only but good humoured. There is a tangible sense of solidarity and common purpose \u2013 to save this country from itself.\u201d He added: \u201cI think the tide is turning.\u201d Here are a selection of posters and images from the march, with people travelling from all over Britain to attend. A group of leftwing politicians, unions and campaigners have come together to launch a united Left Bloc group at the march. The coalition, organised by Another Europe is Possible, is backed by the Green party, the TSSA union, Left Unity, Open Labour and Labour for a Socialist Europe, as well as a number of prominent Labour MPs. Clive Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, said: \u201cBrexit is a Tory project. It\u2019s about deregulating the economy, and attacking the rights of workers and migrant workers alike \u2026 So we are marching together as a left bloc because we refuse to accept the idea the anti-Brexit movement is the property of just centrist politicians.\u201d Left Bloc aimed to mobilise massive turnout from the left, while putting forward a clear leftwing message at the heart of the protest. This includes calling for a Green New Deal and fighting the rise of the far right. They planned to meet at 11am outside the Dorchester hotel to hold a separate rally. The move follows Labour\u2019s shift to backing a second referendum as a means of stopping a Tory-led Brexit. Amelia Womack, the deputy leader of the Green party, said: \u201cIt has never been more important for the left to come together and stand against the politics of hate which has been allowed to run riot in Britain.\u201d Tom Watson, the deputy Labour party leader, will be the star attraction joining the anti-Brexit march in the clearest sign yet that Labour will back a second referendum to end the national crisis. It was previously thought none of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s top team would be at the march. Watson, who has been warned recently that the leadership must accommodate the full spectrum of positions in the Labour party, is expected to tell the crowds: \u201cThe current impasse is not working for people who voted to leave or people who voted to stay. I really don\u2019t think parliament will be able to resolve this. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to the reluctant view that the only way to resolve this and have legitimacy in the eyes of the public is for the people themselves to sign it off.\u201d The move significantly increases the pressure on Corbyn to end months of uncertainty over Labour\u2019s position on a new referendum, before a possible third meaningful vote on the prime minister\u2019s deal next week. As demonstrators continue to arrive in central London, a large banner was unfurled on Westminster Bridge that read \u201cLove socialism, hate Brexit\u201d, a stunt organised by a group calling itself the Left Bloc, which is supported by Labour MPs, including Clive Lewis and Kate Osamor, among others. The march will start in Park Lane at 12pm, proceeding through the centre of the capital to Parliament Square where there will be speeches from 2pm from political leaders, celebrities and campaigners, kicked off by Sir Vince Cable and a group of young campaigners. Among the list of speakers are London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, the comedian and TV presenter Sandi Toksvig, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the Conservative peer Michael Heseltine, the comedian Steve Coogan, and Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. Watson will be speaking just after 3pm. Speaking before her appearance at the rally, where she\u2019ll share a platform with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the Conservative peer Michael Heseltine, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, described the state of political turmoil as \u201cthe moment of maximum opportunity\u201d. In a statement, Sturgeon says: \u201cThe EU\u2019s decision to postpone things until at least April 12 has opened a window, and those of us who oppose Brexit must seize the chance it offers.\u201d Urging the Commons to \u201ctake back control\u201d from May and secure an even longer extension to allow time for a new referendum to be held, she adds: \u201cThe prime minister and her government have proved completely incapable of delivering on the result of the 2016 vote, which is why it is right that this should now go back to the people.\u201d She also insists the Brexit chaos makes the case for Scottish independence \u201cstronger than it has ever been\u201d. Sturgeon is still hedging her bets when it comes to announcing her own plans regarding a second independence referendum. She told the Holyrood chamber at first minister\u2019s question on Thursday that she would lay out her thinking \u201cin the coming days\u201d. Seasoned observers read this as a variation on \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d and \u201cafter the fog of Brexit clears\u201d. These have been the Scottish National party leader\u2019s other favoured formulations as she maintains a challenging balance between the agitation of many party activists and some parliamentarians who want her to act now and her own understanding of the country\u2019s mood. Polling continues to suggest that the public are not keen on a second independence referendum within five years, while Brexit has failed to push support for leaving the UK up to the convincing margin of around 60% that insiders believe is critical for a second poll to succeed. Sturgeon\u2019s presence at the rally is significant though. Her party swung behind a second Brexit referendum late last year, despite the fact that a significant minority of SNP voters supported leave in 2016. Many still hold reservations that a second EU referendum may set an unhelpful precedent for a second independence vote, but throughout the Brexit process Sturgeon has emphasised the SNP\u2019s willingness to work across the parties to reach a workable consensus. Guardian journalist Dan Sabbagh will be reporting from the march today, and he tweeted beforehand to ask people why they are marching. Here are a selection of the responses. Organisers have said hundreds of thousands are expected to descend on London today. Although they wouldn\u2019t give exact numbers they said they hoped it would be bigger than the last march, in October, which drew 700,000. Speakers will include the comedian Steve Coogan, and the broadcaster and journalist Mariella Frostrup will be compering. The former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, joined the March to Leave in Linby, Nottinghamshire today. He spoke to around 200 Brexit supporters, saying Theresa May had reduced the nation \u201cto a state of humiliation\u201d. The march started in Sunderland a week ago and organisers hope to arrive in London on the original Brexit day of 29 March. Farage said those gathering for the People\u2019s Vote march in London were not the majority, before leading the crowds through the village. Speaking to the Press Association, Farage said: \u201cWhat has happened this week is not only a national humiliation but it is an outright betrayal, because Mrs May now tells us we\u2019re not leaving next Friday despite telling us over a hundred times that we would be, despite putting a piece of law in place supported by 500 MPs.\u201d Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday, the former Labour MP David Miliband said: \u201cThis is a time where we have to address the Brexit issue \u2026 it gets in the way of addressing the big issues facing the country.\u201d He also reinforced his support for the Labour party, saying it was deep in his DNA and if there was a vote, he wouldn\u2019t change sides. \u201cI am a Labour supporter, certainly, there is unprecedented strain on the political system,\u201d he said. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog of the People\u2019s Vote march, calling for another vote on Brexit. Hundreds of thousands are expected to descend on central London. Are you going?

On Thursday evening, the 27 other EU leaders agreed to delay the UK\u2019s departure until 22 May \u2013 but only if May gets her deal through the Commons next week. The delay in these circumstances would be to allow enough time for Brexit-related legislation to be passed.

This is an attempt to see if a parliamentary majority can be mustered for a different Brexit model, such as a Norway-style single market membership, or a permanent customs union. On Tuesday May could well put her deal to another \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote (MV3). But if she thinks she is on course to lose again she may shy away. Parliament must vote by the end of the week on a statutory instrument (secondary legislation) to change the intended leaving date on the withdrawal bill from 29 March, to either 22 May (if May\u2019s deal has passed) or 12 April if it hasn\u2019t. It must do this before 11pm on Friday.</p> \n<h2>Is a no-deal Brexit still possible?</h2> \n<p>Yes, very much so. No one (except Brexit hardliners) wants no deal but it still could come to pass because there is no majority for anything else that would avoid it. Whatever new date is set for Brexit, no deal stays as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/22/brexit-uk-has-chance-to-rethink-the-whole-thing-say-eu-leaders\" title=\"\">the default position</a> if parliament cannot agree how we should leave. MPs have twice voted down May\u2019s agreement by huge majorities, and have not come close to agreeing any other plan. We will now leave with no deal on 12 April unless one of several things happen, none of which looks likely. Either MPs have to be converted in sufficient numbers to allow May\u2019s agreement to pass (unlikely); or they have to find a majority for another form of Brexit (possible, but late in the day to try); or they have to back a longer extension which will mean holding European elections; or just shelve Brexit altogether.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dd1e9f3f7f83b925dd3d634d7f24d6feee2ab5b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd1e9f3f7f83b925dd3d634d7f24d6feee2ab5b/0_245_5232_3140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People\u2019s Vote anti-Brexit march\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the thousands of banners and placards.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Could the government and parliament decide to revoke article 50 and cancel Brexit?</h2> \n<p>Yes \u2013 and there are millions of people calling for this to happen. A petition demanding revocation has been signed by more than four million people. It was started in late February by \u201cfrustrated remainer\u201d Margaret Georgiadou, but began to rapidly gain signatures on Wednesday evening. The UK can revoke at any time so long as it is still an EU member, even during an extension to its membership. But doing so remains unlikely as there is little support in parliament. Under government rules, parliament has to consider all petitions that amass more than 100,000 signatures and it is now certainly a hot topic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"85fc05a9-895b-4d9e-9ef2-5d1663bd20f6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/81eLXg21VSA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Could we still have another referendum?</h2> \n<p>Yes. Today\u2019s huge march showed how wide support is. The problem is that there has been insufficient backing so far in parliament. Only a handful of Tory MPs from remain seats openly back the idea and plenty of Labour MPs in leave-supporting seats are against. The Labour leadershp has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/22/labour-deputy-leader-tom-watson-to-address-peoples-vote-rally\" title=\"\">blown hot and cold</a> about a second referendum for months, fearing a backlash from leave voters. Jeremy Corbyn has, however, suggested that Labour will back an amendment by two Labour MPs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/17/compromise-brexit-deal-phil-wilson-peter-kyle\" title=\"\">Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson</a>, that would deliver a second public vote if the right moment is found. Under their plan, MPs would allow May\u2019s deal to pass on condition that there is a confirmatory vote in the country. Labour is worried about being seen to cause no deal and worried about being seen to help May land her deal. With Labour\u2019s strong backing, a vote on the Kyle-Wilson plan, if tabled when the danger of no deal is at its height, could be very close.</p> \n<h2>Can Theresa May stay as prime minister if her deal is defeated yet again?</h2> \n<p>Not for long. May will by then have been defeated three times on the defining issue of her premiership and the most important one to have faced the country since the second world war. It was also the issue on which she called a snap election in 2017 only to lose her majority. She wanted her own mandate on Brexit and failed to get one. Tory MPs on the leave and remain sides of the argument now want her out this summer at the latest even if her deal gets through parliament. If she tries to go on beyond December, there will be another confidence motion by her own MPs, and she is unlikely to survive. The men in grey suits will have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/23/theresa-may-state-of-mind-brexit-farce\" title=\"\">hammering at her door</a> by then. Her statement on Wednesday about MPs obstructing Brexit and playing political games was the last straw for many on her own side. She is on the way out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/23/more-than-4-million-people-sign-petition-to-revoke-article-50-brexit\">More than 4 million sign Brexit petition to revoke article 50</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Could we agree an alternative form of Brexit?</h2> \n<p>Yes, possibly. The process of indicative votes will bring forward different ideas for a soft Brexit, including the Norway-style model of single market membership and close customs cooperation with the EU. Labour will also push its ideas for a permanent customs union. But the chances of forging sufficiently wide cross-party consensus are not high. Anything that looks like a Tory-led plan will put off Labour MPs and vice versa. No side wants to deliver the other side\u2019s Brexit. An arrangement that keeps the UK close to the single market and in a customs union is possible if it could be presented as genuinely non-partisan. But MPs fear that the indicative votes will in the end just show that parliament can\u2019t agree anything \u2013 if it could, it would have done so by now.</p> \n<h2>What is Labour\u2019s policy now?</h2> \n<p>That is arguably the hardest of all questions to answer. In its last manifesto it said it would respect the result of the 2016 referendum. At its party conference in Liverpool last September it agreed to keep a second referendum on the table, with the option to remain being on the ballot paper, if all other possibilities had been exhausted. Since then the leadership has appeared one minute to back a second referendum wholeheartedly, while the next saying it is most interested in promoting its own Brexit plan and trying to force a general election. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary who wants a second referendum and to stay in the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn, who clearly would rather not have a public vote and thinks we should leave, send out very different messages because they seem to want different outcomes.</p>",

It was also the issue on which she called a snap election in 2017 only to lose her majority. She wanted her own mandate on Brexit and failed to get one. Tory MPs on the leave and remain sides of the argument now want her out this summer at the latest even if her deal gets through parliament. If she tries to go on beyond December, there will be another confidence motion by her own MPs, and she is unlikely to survive. The men in grey suits will have been hammering at her door by then. Her statement on Wednesday about MPs obstructing Brexit and playing political games was the last straw for many on her own side. She is on the way out. Could we agree an alternative form of Brexit? Yes, possibly. The process of indicative votes will bring forward different ideas for a soft Brexit, including the Norway-style model of single market membership and close customs cooperation with the EU. Labour will also push its ideas for a permanent customs union. But the chances of forging sufficiently wide cross-party consensus are not high. Anything that looks like a Tory-led plan will put off Labour MPs and vice versa. No side wants to deliver the other side\u2019s Brexit. An arrangement that keeps the UK close to the single market and in a customs union is possible if it could be presented as genuinely non-partisan. But MPs fear that the indicative votes will in the end just show that parliament can\u2019t agree anything \u2013 if it could, it would have done so by now. What is Labour\u2019s policy now? That is arguably the hardest of all questions to answer. In its last manifesto it said it would respect the result of the 2016 referendum. At its party conference in Liverpool last September it agreed to keep a second referendum on the table, with the option to remain being on the ballot paper, if all other possibilities had been exhausted. Since then the leadership has appeared one minute to back a second referendum wholeheartedly, while the next saying it is most interested in promoting its own Brexit plan and trying to force a general election. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary who wants a second referendum and to stay in the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn, who clearly would rather not have a public vote and thinks we should leave, send out very different messages because they seem to want different outcomes.",
