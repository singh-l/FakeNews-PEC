But going into this film, you kinda-sorta know that the gruesome Tate murders are unlikely to play out as they actually did in August 1969, however the fun (and, yes, it is fun, no disrespect to the families of those who were actually killed) is in watching it play out.</p> <p>Brad Pitt\u2019s Cliff Booth is the ultimate Tarantino hero. He works in movies, but in the most workmanlike department \u2013 as a stunt man. He lives behind a drive-in. He spends his days driving around Hollywood doing odd jobs, looking cool, smiling at women (but mostly regarding them from afar). And when duty calls and the job requires it, he can swiftly unleash preposterous amounts of deadly violence. His attack with a can of dog food to prevent the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/tarantino-cannes-behind-the-bloodshed-chilling-untold-stories-charles-manson\">Manson Family</a> killers from making their way up the hill to Roman Polanski\u2019s rented home will go down as one of the strangest and most shocking attacks in cinema.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57a5d8d0e1add2a8aafa692c6df2e4f8231601cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57a5d8d0e1add2a8aafa692c6df2e4f8231601cf/0_0_3504_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ultimate man \u2026 Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ultimate man \u2026 Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cooper/Allstar/Columbia Pictures Corporation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spahn Movie Ranch</h2> <p>The languid pace in OUATIH (sorry, I can\u2019t type out the full title any more) allows Tarantino to use the Hollywood of the Mind as an exploratory sandbox. It\u2019s perfect, then, that one of the tensest scenes (and one that a screenwriting professor would likely suggest be truncated, further proving Tarantino\u2019s greatness) is set at the Spahn Movie Ranch.</p> <p>Out on the edge of Los Angeles, the ranch was used for mid-century film and television productions of exactly the sort that Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character Rick Dalton would appear in. By the late 1960s, the owner, the old and blind George Spahn had turned the shooting location into something of a \u201cwild west\u201d tourism spot, but it was hardly on most visitors\u2019 must-see list. Gradually, members of Charles Manson\u2019s \u201chippie cult\u201d moved in until they basically had the run of the place by the time of the Tate-LaBianca murders.</p> <p>It\u2019s a footnote in late 1960s California movie lore, so it\u2019s a natural that Tarantino, forever obsessed with the near-forgotten, would set the lengthiest sequence of his film there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b44afbbd99b42b4d1a41ab4230d8226d7ad7d54a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b44afbbd99b42b4d1a41ab4230d8226d7ad7d54a/0_0_3504_2433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leonardo DiCaprio on set \u2026 Tarantino\u2019s locations tell their own story.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leonardo DiCaprio on set \u2026 Tarantino\u2019s locations tell their own story.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cooper/Allstar/Sony Pictures Entertainment</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The legend of Bruce Lee</h2> <p>Can Batman beat up Superman? It\u2019s a question comic-book fans still (embarrassingly) ask and (even worse) some have an answer to.

Issues of respectability aside, the question remains if the fight \u201cactually happened\u201d or if it was something in Cliff\u2019s head. We see the fight in a flashback that also includes a scene drawn from overheard conversation, in which we <em>also</em> see a flash of someone else\u2019s thought\u2019s about Cliff (eg. did he kill his wife?) It\u2019s a little confusing, and intentionally so, but remember that this movie\u2019s title is Once Upon a Time, so perhaps we shouldn\u2019t take all of this too literally.</p> <h2>The film\u2019s sole</h2> <p>At some point in the last decade I became aware that Tarantino was into feet. Hey, everybody\u2019s into something.

      "bodyText": "Quentin Tarantino, the ur-Gen X movie geek director, has, for some time, suggested that he wants to make 10 films then retire. (He insists that Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 are one movie, though I remember buying two tickets.) By his count he\u2019s got one more to go, but walking out of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood there\u2019s a feeling of \u201cGee, what exactly is there left to say?\u201d All of Tarantino\u2019s passions \u2013 the unhurried \u201changing out\u201d vibe between ultracool men, the lost pop culture ephemera, the tweaked idols of childhood, the lore of movie-making and fiery explosions of over-the-top violence \u2013 are on display. The film\u2019s conclusion, the literal opening of New Hollywood\u2019s gates, make perfect punctuation to the end of a career. (This is partly why I don\u2019t think he\u2019s kidding when he says he\u2019d like to do a Star Trek project next. He wants to take the ride again, but not necessarily in his own ship.) There\u2019s a lot to unpack in this two-hour-and-45-minute film, especially when you get past the dead end of counting Margot Robbie\u2019s spoken lines to ascertain if the film respects women. (Lillian Gish didn\u2019t talk much in a lot of her movies either.) These are some topics that kept us buzzing. Revisionist history That Sharon Tate is a key player in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and doesn\u2019t end up dead isn\u2019t, weirdly, that big of a surprise.

And when duty calls and the job requires it, he can swiftly unleash preposterous amounts of deadly violence. His attack with a can of dog food to prevent the Manson Family killers from making their way up the hill to Roman Polanski\u2019s rented home will go down as one of the strangest and most shocking attacks in cinema.

It\u2019s perfect, then, that one of the tensest scenes (and one that a screenwriting professor would likely suggest be truncated, further proving Tarantino\u2019s greatness) is set at the Spahn Movie Ranch.

The newly created states of India and Pakistan had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict\" title=\"\">gone to war</a> over Muslim-majority Kashmir, an independent kingdom at the time. After mediation from the United Nations, all parties agreed that the future of Kashmir was to be decided later via a referendum \u2013 something India and Pakistan have failed to honour. The provisions of the article meant that, pending the final resolution via a plebiscite, the state had its own constitution, its own national flag, a prime minister and a president, even as successive Indian regimes, starting in the early 1950s, diluted the article in order to diminish Kashmir\u2019s autonomy.</p> <p>India has also abrogated article 35A, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_35A_of_the_Constitution_of_India\" title=\"\">introduced in 1954</a>. It empowers the state legislature in Srinagar, the capital, to define who is a permanent resident with the right to buy property and apply for jobs. It\u2019s the dissolution of this article that perhaps presents a graver threat to Kashmiris, as it potentially clears a way for Indians to acquire land.</p> <p>By erasing what was left of its independence the government of India, led by Narendra Modi, has chosen to unilaterally alter the future of an entire people (who have never submitted to Indian sovereignty). Not only that, it has effectively instituted a mass detention of Kashmiris by rushing in thousands of troops in addition to the half a million already stationed there.</p> <p>All of this happened without any consultation with Kashmiris, without any discussion among India\u2019s own parliamentarians, and, most crucially, without any sound legal foundation. Article 370 can only be amended with the approval of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, which was dissolved in 1956. In its absence, it falls to the legislative assembly of Kashmir to debate and approve any changes to the article, but India suspended that in November last year, putting the state under its direct rule. In place of an elected government, Delhi sent a governor to rule Kashmir.</p> <p>Legal and Kashmir experts agree that a man who\u2019s neither elected nor a representative of the Kashmiri people cannot be a surrogate for an elected body. The necessary legal approval for the revocation, according to India\u2019s own constitutional guarantees, was never sought, therefore rendering the whole exercise a farce, a travesty of democratic norms.</p> <p>As part of this shock-and-awe move, political and civil leaders in Kashmir, including unionists who\u2019ve been arguing India\u2019s case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/kashmir-leaders-placed-under-arrest-amid-security-crackdown\" title=\"\">have been arrested</a>. The entire population is under the severest curfew in decades and an unprecedented communications blockade has been put in place, with mobile phones, broadband, even landlines blocked. The world\u2019s largest democracy has cut off Kashmir from the rest of the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e2954b32649f20e2fff5f06f89a92a9967fac49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2954b32649f20e2fff5f06f89a92a9967fac49/166_561_4168_2501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Narendra Modi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Narendra Modi\u2019s vision is for a majoritarian, Hindu-first nation where all debate, difference, and dissent will be crushed.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Panthaky/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decision, however, has wide support across India. Most political parties, most of the Indian media, film stars, some writers \u2013 everyone seems to say in unison: take away the rights of these ungrateful Muslims. Imagine a small landlocked region with a few million people incarcerated in their own homes, up against a mighty power, its army, its people, its media, and you get a sense of the crushing injustice of the situation.</p> <p>India\u2019s treatment of Kashmiris is the clearest glimpse yet of the path that Modi, a Hindu nationalist leader, wants to tread. His vision is for a majoritarian, Hindu-first nation where all debate, difference and dissent will be crushed. The rebellious others on the margins, especially if Muslim, are to be subjugated and subjected to a medieval siege to force them to bend to the will of the mega-state. For some, this comes complete with references to spoils of war.

      "bodyText": "I haven\u2019t been able to hear the voices of my parents for more than a week now. We usually talk or exchange messages a few times during the day, mostly about their creeping health issues or about my children\u2019s latest antics here in London. But now, not a peep. It\u2019s because, like all Kashmiris, they\u2019re under siege, experiencing the worst crackdown in three decades, imposed by the Indian government as it revoked the region\u2019s autonomy by abrogating article 370 of the constitution. The article, dating back to 1949, guaranteed Kashmir\u2019s special status within the larger Indian union and enshrined the conditions of the state\u2019s accession to India soon after partition in 1947. The newly created states of India and Pakistan had gone to war over Muslim-majority Kashmir, an independent kingdom at the time. After mediation from the United Nations, all parties agreed that the future of Kashmir was to be decided later via a referendum \u2013 something India and Pakistan have failed to honour. The provisions of the article meant that, pending the final resolution via a plebiscite, the state had its own constitution, its own national flag, a prime minister and a president, even as successive Indian regimes, starting in the early 1950s, diluted the article in order to diminish Kashmir\u2019s autonomy. India has also abrogated article 35A, introduced in 1954. It empowers the state legislature in Srinagar, the capital, to define who is a permanent resident with the right to buy property and apply for jobs. It\u2019s the dissolution of this article that perhaps presents a graver threat to Kashmiris, as it potentially clears a way for Indians to acquire land. By erasing what was left of its independence the government of India, led by Narendra Modi, has chosen to unilaterally alter the future of an entire people (who have never submitted to Indian sovereignty). Not only that, it has effectively instituted a mass detention of Kashmiris by rushing in thousands of troops in addition to the half a million already stationed there. All of this happened without any consultation with Kashmiris, without any discussion among India\u2019s own parliamentarians, and, most crucially, without any sound legal foundation. Article 370 can only be amended with the approval of the Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, which was dissolved in 1956. In its absence, it falls to the legislative assembly of Kashmir to debate and approve any changes to the article, but India suspended that in November last year, putting the state under its direct rule. In place of an elected government, Delhi sent a governor to rule Kashmir. Legal and Kashmir experts agree that a man who\u2019s neither elected nor a representative of the Kashmiri people cannot be a surrogate for an elected body. The necessary legal approval for the revocation, according to India\u2019s own constitutional guarantees, was never sought, therefore rendering the whole exercise a farce, a travesty of democratic norms. As part of this shock-and-awe move, political and civil leaders in Kashmir, including unionists who\u2019ve been arguing India\u2019s case, have been arrested. The entire population is under the severest curfew in decades and an unprecedented communications blockade has been put in place, with mobile phones, broadband, even landlines blocked. The world\u2019s largest democracy has cut off Kashmir from the rest of the world. The decision, however, has wide support across India. Most political parties, most of the Indian media, film stars, some writers \u2013 everyone seems to say in unison: take away the rights of these ungrateful Muslims. Imagine a small landlocked region with a few million people incarcerated in their own homes, up against a mighty power, its army, its people, its media, and you get a sense of the crushing injustice of the situation. India\u2019s treatment of Kashmiris is the clearest glimpse yet of the path that Modi, a Hindu nationalist leader, wants to tread. His vision is for a majoritarian, Hindu-first nation where all debate, difference and dissent will be crushed. The rebellious others on the margins, especially if Muslim, are to be subjugated and subjected to a medieval siege to force them to bend to the will of the mega-state. For some, this comes complete with references to spoils of war. Two lawmakers from the ruling party, including a chief minister, have made jokes about \u201cbringing in girls\u201d from Kashmir. Kashmiris will inevitably see this new attack on their body politic as part of a long list of betrayals, and it reinforces the idea that India\u2019s behaviour towards Kashmir has always been like that of a coloniser. The erasure of autonomy, however tenuous, however token, is the starkest display of that relationship \u2013 and it\u2019s important to remember that Kashmir is subject to the densest militarisation on the planet. A video filmed by the BBC shows thousands protesting after Friday prayers in Srinagar. Another video, recorded by Indian journalist Siddharth Varadarajan, shows boys in hospital beds who\u2019ve already been hit in the eyes with lead pellets. As statist Indian journalists (some of whom have been given access to Kashmir while most local journalists remain incommunicado) work overtime to project a narrative of normality, it has fallen to the international media, and a few brave Indian outlets, to report the truth. The BBC, the New York Times, Reuters, Al Jazeera, the Guardian, the Wire India, Scroll India, Telegraph India and a few others have shown protest marches, wounded civilians, and a grieving people seething with anger, despite the unprecedented siege. Addressing the people of Kashmir in 1952, India\u2019s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, said: \u201cKashmir is not the property of India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people ... We have taken the issue to the United Nations and give our word of honour for a peaceful solution. As a great nation, we cannot go back on it. We have left the question of final solution to the people of Kashmir and we are determined to abide by their decision.\u201d India has now done exactly what Nehru ruled out, going back on its word, and scripted a final betrayal of the Kashmiri people. The journey from being a colony of the British empire to colonising the unyielding Muslim other next door reveals a catastrophic mutation at the heart of the Indian state. I asked a Kashmiri journalist who had returned to Delhi after spending two days in the state if he knew where it was all headed. He responded with one word, Falasteen, the Urdu for Palestine \u2013 a clear reference to the settler-colonialist occupation there. I pray that when I go home next, I do not visit my parents in a colony of the Hindu nationalist empire. \u2022 Mirza Waheed is a journalist and author of the novels The Collaborator and The Book of Gold Leaves",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that it had asked the UN security council for an urgent meeting on the matter, while Khan has previously vowed to lobby heads of state over what he says are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/11/imran-khan-likens-global-inaction-on-kashmir-to-appeasing-hitler\">illegal actions</a> by the Indian government.

      "bodyText": "Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has threatened to \u201cteach Delhi a lesson\u201d and vowed to fight until the end against any Indian violations in disputed Kashmir. In some of his strongest words since Delhi revoked Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s special status last week, Khan said the army was preparing to respond to anticipated Indian aggression in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. \u201cThe Pakistani army has solid information that they [India] are planning to do something in Pakistani Kashmir, and they are ready and will give a solid response,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe have decided that if India commits any type of violation we will fight until the end,\u201d Khan said during a visit to Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in a speech marking Pakistan\u2019s independence day. \u201cThe time has arrived to teach you a lesson,\u201d he said. Pakistan, which also claims Kashmir and has fought wars with India over the region, responded furiously to Delhi\u2019s decision last week to revoke Indian-administered Kashmir\u2019s special status. It compared the Indian government to Nazis and suggested they might carry out ethnic cleansing. Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that it had asked the UN security council for an urgent meeting on the matter, while Khan has previously vowed to lobby heads of state over what he says are illegal actions by the Indian government. The response by other global powers has so far been muted. Millions of people in Indian-administered Kashmir remain without landlines, mobiles or internet access, 10 days after an unprecedented blackout imposed hours before India made its announcement. The territory will remain under a curfew on Thursday as India marks its independence day, a date usually accompanied by protests. Local media reported some restrictions would be eased after Thursday, but said the communications shutdown would stay in place. Delhi\u2019s decision strips the disputed state of Kashmir and Jammu of any elements of autonomy, removing its constitution and flag, and scrapping laws that prevented outsiders from buying land. The state will also be split in two. It is the most radical change in Kashmir since the region joined the Indian union, and many Kashmiris fear it will alter the demography of what is the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. \u201cIt\u2019s an existential battle now,\u201d the Kashmiri politician Shah Faesal told the Guardian on Tuesday. He was reportedly detained at Delhi airport on Wednesday. Other high-profile politicians, including Omar Abdullah, the scion of a prominent political family in Kashmir, and a former chief minister in the state, were arrested last week. Faesal said Delhi\u2019s actions were \u201can insult to the dignity of the people\u201d, adding: \u201cMy belief is that it will have immediate and long-term consequences. We will see ground mobilisation in the coming days and in the long run you will have sentiment of alienation going further and [it will] erupt.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe common refrain is that everything has finished. Everything has been snatched from us. These are the common lines on every Kashmiri\u2019s lips these days. We have no choice left but to resist.\u201d Faesal was previously held up as an example of how Kashmiris could succeed in India\u2019s mainstream. He left the Indian administrative service this year to launch a political party, the Jammu and Kashmir People\u2019s Movement (JKPM). Delhi\u2019s actions had destroyed any remaining trust in mainstream politics, he said. \u201cAnybody who used to promote the idea that it is possible to have a future with India \u2013 all those people are discredited today.\u201d About 500 people have reportedly been arrested since the security clampdown began, apparently to prevent disorder. Despite strict curfews and a heavy paramilitary presence, 10,000 people protested on the streets of Kashmir\u2019s main city, Srinagar, last week when the curfew was briefly lifted for Friday prayers. India has said the protests were not representative of all people\u2019s opinions, and has downplayed demonstrations, initially suggesting no more than 20 people were involved. BBC footage appeared to show huge crowds on the streets. The communications blackout and restrictions on movement mean there is a lack of independent information about what is happening in Kashmir. Satya Pal Malik, the state governor, told the Times of India the severing of communications was to prevent unrest. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to give that instrument to the enemy until things settle down,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a week or 10 days, everything will be all right and we will gradually open lines of communication.\u201d Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Coalport station, Shropshire Coalport, built in 1861, was never a bustling hub even at the height of the Industrial Revolution. Today, its owners, Lisa and Steve Rawlings, who fell in love with the sleepy, disused station, platforms and waiting room, capitalise on its bucolic location in the heart of Ironbridge Gorge, offering self-catering stays in two converted carriages. On the outside, the retired GWR rolling stock, in trademark chocolate and mustard, looks old-school but inside it\u2019s all pale wood, cream leather sofas and corner whirlpool baths, plus retro rail posters on the walls. In four acres with woodland boardwalk trails on the doorstep, it\u2019s close to a gastropub, the Woodbridge Inn, on the banks of the River Severn, named after the bridge that once connected it to the village of Coalport. \u2022 Sleep four and six, from \u00a3370 for a two-night break in a four-person carriage, coalportstation.com Alpine Apartments, Betws-y-Coed, Conwy valley When a South African artist, photographer and environmentalist comes to Snowdonia national park and decides to turns his hand to restoration and interior design, the result is going to be interesting. With his Welsh wife, Gwyn, Jacha Potgieter has turned this 19th-century station into a creative hub with a coffee shop, gallery and, on the first floor, five holiday apartments. Described as \u201choneymoonish\u201d, apartment six is a bijoux bolthole with a bespoke metal headboard in the shape of angel\u2019s wings, and a flower-fringed balcony looking out over the platform to the hills beyond. Mexican-inspired apartment 10 is boudoir-chic, with hot pink walls and striking artworks, while apartment four has a Mexican-made terracotta tiled floor. Sleeping from two to six, they are furnished with items from Jacha\u2019s travels, such as Moorish doors, Arabic rugs and chandeliers, along with artistically upcycled pieces: bare boards, feathered lamps, chapel chairs and the odd romantic roll-top tub.

You can almost imagine Jenny Agutter running down the platform waving her hankie. The last full-time signalman and station master decamped in 1946 and this traditional stone house is now a heritage-themed hideaway.

The interiors are museum-like and crammed with authentic details. There\u2019s a wind-up gramophone in the claret-hued sitting room; the kitchen has a traditional range and sink (along with an electric oven hidden away) and a pantry.
