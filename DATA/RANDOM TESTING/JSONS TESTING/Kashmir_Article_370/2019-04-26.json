As followers bombarded Adonis on Twitter, Facebook and email asking for urgent clarification, others in the Twitter political playground began making mischief. Tory MP James Cleverly wrote: \u201cIf you read the first letter, of the second word, on every third line of this Facebook post a coded message says \u201cHelp me, Seumas is making me write this Brexit stuff that I don\u2019t believe.\u201d\u201d Many others were also quick to suggest a role for Seumas Milne, Corbyn\u2019s pro-Brexit director of strategy and communications, who is widely seen as the man guiding Corbyn: \u201creads like a hostage statement dictated by Seumas Milne\u201d wrote Times columnist Iain Martin. A full 24 hours after his Facebook post, Adonis explained on Twitter: \u201cMy statement yesterday is Labour\u2019s approved conference policy. It doesn\u2019t change my commitment to a public vote on any Brexit deal.\u201d Few were appeased. Throughout Thursday, Adonis lost 2,300 Twitter followers. Though \u201conly\u201d 2% of his followership, it\u2019s the highly active followership on Twitter that counts. The big pro-EU beast on Twitter has seen his engagement rate drop heavily and replies to his tweets are dominated by admonishments. The remain community is clearly in no mood to forgive. Unlike in 2017, the remainers are under no existential obligation to back Labour tactically in the 2019 European elections. After two years of being strung along with ambiguity, many would eagerly punish Labour. The Labour leadership is pushing opportunity into the jaws of defeat, given its overwhelmingly pro-European base. The international commission of Labour\u2019s national policy forum, which includes trade unionists, MPs and constituency reps, has just voted unanimously that Labour\u2019s EU election manifesto should pledge to hold a confirmatory referendum. On the same day, the Huffington Post obtained a draft Labour leaflet for the European elections saying that Labour would go ahead with Brexit and seek \u201ca better deal with Europe\u201d, with no mention of a confirmatory vote. It reported that neither Keir Starmer nor the head of the Labour MEPs, Richard Corbett, were consulted on the leaflet\u2019s content. If that is the case, it is plain outrageous. Whatever you think of Andrew Adonis\u2019s unhappy moment, it is the secretive and dictatorial clique within Corbyn\u2019s office that has brought party policy to breaking point with its base. If there is anyone who needs to do a volte-face, it is the Labour leadership \u2013 and right now. \u2022 Dr Mike Galsworthy is director of the campaigns Scientists for EU and NHS for a People\u2019s Vote",
