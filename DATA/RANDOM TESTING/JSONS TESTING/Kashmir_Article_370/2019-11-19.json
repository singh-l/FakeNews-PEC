      "body": "<p>The contemporary culture of spoiler paranoia is hardly ever one that collides with the romantic comedy genre: who walks into a romcom <em>not </em>knowing more or less what\u2019s going to happen by the time the credits roll? Last Christmas, however, is a bit of an exception: from the moment the trailer for the latest fuzzy diversion from Bridesmaids director Paul Feig hit the internet back in August, it seemed clear this one wouldn\u2019t end in the usual way. Were we right? Nothing but spoilers ahead, obviously.</p> <h2><strong>So, that </strong><strong>\u2018twist</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9CEIcmWmtA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z9CEIcmWmtA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The internet hivemind can be wrong about many things, but when it came to cracking the secret of Last Christmas from its trailer \u2013 which, at three minutes, was unusually long and information-packed \u2013 it didn\u2019t take people long to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/15/emilia-clarke-last-christmas-ghost-emma-thompson\">put two and two together</a>.

After all, would Feig and screenwriters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/emma-thompson\">Emma Thompson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bryony-kimmings\">Bryony Kimmings</a> really hinge an entire film on what is essentially one goofily literal bit of wordplay? Unfortunately, it turns out that\u2019s exactly what they did: in what amounts to one of the more colossal failures by a studio marketing department in recent years, the film effectively spoiled itself three months ahead of schedule. (<a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a29808391/last-christmas-director-paul-feig-trailer/\">Feig has since admitted his regrets</a>.)</p> <p>Had it been unexpected, this stickily sentimental supernatural turn might at least have had a certain euphoric WTF quality: as it is, when you spend the whole film tracking the buildup, small, illogical details only become more glaring. (Why <em>did </em>ill-fated bike courier Tom keep his mobile phone in a cupboard at home while on the job?) And even when you know what\u2019s coming, the actual reveal is botched through sloppy montage: why base a whole film on this one bad joke if not to have Golding actually, with tears sparkling in his eyes, earnestly deliver the line, \u201cLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\u201d? How could Thompson and Feig overlook such sublime camp potential? Humbug.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Yugoslavia, 1999</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dbeabd573ae4779308c185eff4083fe538ddc8de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbeabd573ae4779308c185eff4083fe538ddc8de/271_18_3488_2093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A terminal case of lugubriousness ...

Clarke and Thompson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least knowing the twist in advance gives you some headspace to focus on the film\u2019s peculiar grasp of modern history, signalled in the very first scene \u2013 a prologue introducing young Kate\u2019s (or Katarina\u2019s, to use her loathed birth name) musical talents in a church choir \u2013 by a title card announcing the time and place as \u201cYugoslavia, 1999\u201d. Much is made of Kate\u2019s family having fled the conflict in Yugoslavia to settle in London, an ordeal that has given her mother (Thompson, sporting a dismally generic comedy <em>borscht </em>accent) a seemingly terminal case of lugubriousness.</p> <p>The chronology is baffling, though: you\u2019d expect someone at some stage in the script development process to have pointed out that the breakup of Yugoslavia took place seven years earlier, in 1992. Do they mean specifically the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by which Serbia and Montenegro was known until 2003? Which of the Yugoslav wars did Kate\u2019s family flee? The film could have made things easier for itself (and us) by not wedding itself to such specific dates and just ambling around in an alternative Hollywood timeline. But then it couldn\u2019t have treated us to its various cringe-inducing references to Brexit Britain, which are cannily calculated to come down inarguably on the side of hard-working, salt of the earth immigrants without committing to a leave or remain stance. </p> <h2><strong>George Michael: father figure</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a22de44dede6e75c871040ebffc5a3e8e51f5266\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a22de44dede6e75c871040ebffc5a3e8e51f5266/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"May as well have been conceived around Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s Christmas album ...

Clarke and Golding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Prime/Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kate\u2019s fandom for the former Wham! frontman is explained as an affinity for artists who were \u201cmisunderstood and underappreciated in their time\u201d. She\u2019s young, and perhaps hasn\u2019t perused Michael\u2019s extensive list of No 1 records on both sides of the Atlantic, but \u201cunderappreciated\u201d feels a stretch: the film certainly misunderstands Michael, so we\u2019ll allow that one. Thompson has repeatedly explained in interviews that the project began, with the singer\u2019s blessing, as an attempt to build a very British comedy around the George Michael songbook \u2013 his own Mamma Mia!, minus the actual musical numbers \u2013 so it\u2019s odd that the film plays as if the Michael theme were a very late afterthought.</p> <p>Aside from the obvious, narratively integral presence of Last Christmas, Michael\u2019s songs feel both randomly selected and haphazardly applied in the film \u2013 as if, late in proceedings, Feig and Thompson took a closer listen to the singer\u2019s oeuvre, realised only a single lyric could be aptly shoehorned into the daft plot, and decided to make the best of things. (What does Freedom \u201990 have to do with a montage of Kate and her mum traipsing around a Christmas market? Nothing at all, but it\u2019s still a tune, so that makes for one of the film\u2019s brighter moments.)</p> <p>Most perplexing is the preponderance of Michael\u2019s dourer ballads on the soundtrack: Faith and Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go make brief appearances, but Heal the Pain, Waiting for That Day and Praying for Time (an unplugged version, no less) are prominently showcased. It\u2019s supposed to be a fun film, so where are the bangers? Could I\u2019m Your Man or I Knew You Were Waiting for Me not have been easily cued up by the featherweight plotting? At least we know why I Want Your Sex, Outside and Freeek! are missing: the film, like the chemistry between Golding and Clarke, is as sexless as a Christmas stollen. (It\u2019s hard to make love to a ghost, admittedly, but they could have tried.) George Michael deserved a hot, fabulous, boundlessly queer cinematic tribute: this may as well have been conceived around Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s Christmas album. </p>",

Last Christmas, however, is a bit of an exception: from the moment the trailer for the latest fuzzy diversion from Bridesmaids director Paul Feig hit the internet back in August, it seemed clear this one wouldn\u2019t end in the usual way. Were we right? Nothing but spoilers ahead, obviously. So, that \u2018twist\u2019 The internet hivemind can be wrong about many things, but when it came to cracking the secret of Last Christmas from its trailer \u2013 which, at three minutes, was unusually long and information-packed \u2013 it didn\u2019t take people long to put two and two together. The film is billed as a riff on the music of George Michael, named after the song Last Christmas, with that incessant \u201cI gave you my heart\u201d refrain \u2026 We hear manic pixie nightmare Kate (Emilia Clarke) telling us that she \u201cnearly died last year\u201d over what look suspiciously like scenes of heart surgery \u2026 Oh God, could mysterious, slightly otherworldly dreamboat Tom (Henry Golding) be the benevolent ghost of her heart donor? Some argued that perhaps that was exactly what the trailer wanted us to think, and we were somehow being wrongfooted. After all, would Feig and screenwriters Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings really hinge an entire film on what is essentially one goofily literal bit of wordplay? Unfortunately, it turns out that\u2019s exactly what they did: in what amounts to one of the more colossal failures by a studio marketing department in recent years, the film effectively spoiled itself three months ahead of schedule. (Feig has since admitted his regrets.) Had it been unexpected, this stickily sentimental supernatural turn might at least have had a certain euphoric WTF quality: as it is, when you spend the whole film tracking the buildup, small, illogical details only become more glaring. (Why did ill-fated bike courier Tom keep his mobile phone in a cupboard at home while on the job?) And even when you know what\u2019s coming, the actual reveal is botched through sloppy montage: why base a whole film on this one bad joke if not to have Golding actually, with tears sparkling in his eyes, earnestly deliver the line, \u201cLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\u201d? How could Thompson and Feig overlook such sublime camp potential? Humbug. \u2018Yugoslavia, 1999\u2019 At least knowing the twist in advance gives you some headspace to focus on the film\u2019s peculiar grasp of modern history, signalled in the very first scene \u2013 a prologue introducing young Kate\u2019s (or Katarina\u2019s, to use her loathed birth name) musical talents in a church choir \u2013 by a title card announcing the time and place as \u201cYugoslavia, 1999\u201d. Much is made of Kate\u2019s family having fled the conflict in Yugoslavia to settle in London, an ordeal that has given her mother (Thompson, sporting a dismally generic comedy borscht accent) a seemingly terminal case of lugubriousness. The chronology is baffling, though: you\u2019d expect someone at some stage in the script development process to have pointed out that the breakup of Yugoslavia took place seven years earlier, in 1992. Do they mean specifically the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by which Serbia and Montenegro was known until 2003? Which of the Yugoslav wars did Kate\u2019s family flee? The film could have made things easier for itself (and us) by not wedding itself to such specific dates and just ambling around in an alternative Hollywood timeline. But then it couldn\u2019t have treated us to its various cringe-inducing references to Brexit Britain, which are cannily calculated to come down inarguably on the side of hard-working, salt of the earth immigrants without committing to a leave or remain stance. George Michael: father figure Kate\u2019s fandom for the former Wham! frontman is explained as an affinity for artists who were \u201cmisunderstood and underappreciated in their time\u201d. She\u2019s young, and perhaps hasn\u2019t perused Michael\u2019s extensive list of No 1 records on both sides of the Atlantic, but \u201cunderappreciated\u201d feels a stretch: the film certainly misunderstands Michael, so we\u2019ll allow that one. Thompson has repeatedly explained in interviews that the project began, with the singer\u2019s blessing, as an attempt to build a very British comedy around the George Michael songbook \u2013 his own Mamma Mia!, minus the actual musical numbers \u2013 so it\u2019s odd that the film plays as if the Michael theme were a very late afterthought. Aside from the obvious, narratively integral presence of Last Christmas, Michael\u2019s songs feel both randomly selected and haphazardly applied in the film \u2013 as if, late in proceedings, Feig and Thompson took a closer listen to the singer\u2019s oeuvre, realised only a single lyric could be aptly shoehorned into the daft plot, and decided to make the best of things. (What does Freedom \u201990 have to do with a montage of Kate and her mum traipsing around a Christmas market? Nothing at all, but it\u2019s still a tune, so that makes for one of the film\u2019s brighter moments.) Most perplexing is the preponderance of Michael\u2019s dourer ballads on the soundtrack: Faith and Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go make brief appearances, but Heal the Pain, Waiting for That Day and Praying for Time (an unplugged version, no less) are prominently showcased. It\u2019s supposed to be a fun film, so where are the bangers? Could I\u2019m Your Man or I Knew You Were Waiting for Me not have been easily cued up by the featherweight plotting? At least we know why I Want Your Sex, Outside and Freeek! are missing: the film, like the chemistry between Golding and Clarke, is as sexless as a Christmas stollen. (It\u2019s hard to make love to a ghost, admittedly, but they could have tried.) George Michael deserved a hot, fabulous, boundlessly queer cinematic tribute: this may as well have been conceived around Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s Christmas album.",
