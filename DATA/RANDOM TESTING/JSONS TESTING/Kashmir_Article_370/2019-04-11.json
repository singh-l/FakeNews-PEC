The prime minister addressed the House of Commons after her return from the late-night summit in Brussels at which EU27 leaders thrashed out an extension to article 50. She stressed her determination to plough ahead with cross-party talks aimed at striking a Brexit consensus; and shrugged off calls for her resignation from backbenchers furious at the fresh delay. \u201cLet us use the opportunity of the recess to reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swiftly on our return after Easter. And let us then resolve to find a way through this impasse. So that we can leave the EU with a deal as soon as possible,\u201d May told MPs. Andrea Leadsom, Leader of the House of Commons, had earlier confirmed that parliament would go into recess \u2013 a week later than originally planned \u2013 meaning MPs can return to their constituencies. May said the government would continue to talk to Labour about finding a Brexit compromise. \u201cHowever challenging it may be politically, I profoundly believe that in this unique situation where the house is deadlocked, it is incumbent on both front benches to seek to work together to deliver what the British people voted for.

May later met Corbyn for 10 minutes, after an earlier discussion between officials. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cBoth sides agreed to continue talks in an effort to make substantive progress towards finding a compromise plan.\u201d May insisted that if MPs could pass a deal before 22 May, Britain could still avoid having to participate in European parliament elections and leave the EU at the end of that month. The veteran Conservative MP Bill Cash responded to her statement by calling the extension of article 50 an \u201cabject surrender\u201d and asking her if she would resign. Another vocal Brexiter, Peter Bone, reminded her of her commitment not to allow article 50 to be extended beyond 30 June. Steve Baker, the vice-chair of the European Research Group, asked whether \u2013 if she was willing to force through a deal \u201cover the heads\u201d of her own party and the DUP \u2013 she would be \u201cseeking the confidence of the Labour party\u201d. May blamed the Brexiters\u2019 own intransigence for the failure of her deal to pass; and gave little sign of being rattled by the latest calls for her resignation. Brexiters privately admit that having triggered a vote of no confidence in the prime minister last December, they now have no mechanism to dislodge her, unless she chooses to go. Tory rules say leaders who see off a challenge are given a year\u2019s grace. However, former Brexit secretary David Davis suggested she would now face a growing chorus of calls for her departure, after accepting another delay to Brexit, rather than opting to leave without a deal. He told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that after promising to step down if her deal was passed last month \u2013 before it was rejected by MPs for a third time \u2013 she would now be pressured to go: \u201cWhen prime ministers put a date on their own departure, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy \u2026 The pressure on her to go will increase dramatically, I suspect now. \u201cWhether it comes to anything, who knows? The rules are the rules. There will be pressure on her to go, there will a new leader and then a reset in the negotiations.\u201d Davis said it would be difficult to see how May could continue to be leader until the Conservative party conference in the autumn. In his response to May\u2019s statement, Corbyn issued a fresh warning against allowing a future Tory leader to use Brexit to unleash a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d by slashing regulation and undermining workers\u2019 rights. Labour is pressing for the government to find a way of enshrining its promises on workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards into legislation, to avoid them being unpicked. Corbyn acknowledged the negotiations were \u201cserious, detailed and ongoing\u201d, but warned that some ministers, including the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, appeared to be resisting the necessary compromises. \u201cIf the government is serious, the red lines must move and we must see a real compromise,\u201d he said. A Downing Street spokesman said that if both sides could not agree a deal, then talks with Labour would not continue indefinitely. Party leaders would instead attempt to agree a way to get a parliamentary majority for a Brexit outcome. \u201cBluntly, we will not continue to talk for the sake of it,\u201d said the spokesman. \u201cBut we believe the discussion and dialogue we are having is valuable and we want to see that continue while we think we are making progress. \u201cWe are invested in this and she told fellow leaders last night ... this is not the usual way of doing things in British politics.\u201d A plan has been discussed with Labour, though not agreed, to bring forward the withdrawal agreement bill, which could be a way to attempt to bypass a meaningful vote in parliament and allow MPs to amend the bill as a route to try to achieve a parliamentary majority. If talks on a cross-party deal founder, the two sides could also discuss holding a series of votes, aimed at identifying a form of future relationship with the EU that could command a majority.

Andrew Syme Perth, Scotland \u2022 In the forthcoming election, could we arrange to have three candidates in each EU constituency. One would be the \u201cremain\u201d candidate, another would be the \u201cno deal\u201d candidate, and the third would be the \u201cMrs May\u2019s deal\u201d candidate. If a constituency can only muster two potential candidates I would be prepared to stand on any of the three platforms. Natalie Kehr Hornchurch, Essex \u2022 Given the EU\u2019s extension of the UK\u2019s departure date to 31 October, and the political gravity of the Brexit crisis, presumably MPs will scrap the parliamentary recess currently planned for the whole of July and August and stay at Westminster to find a resolution? Mick Beeby Bristol \u2022 Surely it would have been more appropriate to extend the Brexit deadline until 5 November rather than 31 October. Stephen Jensen Saltash, Cornwall \u2022 We have Brexit 2 pencilled in for Halloween; Brexit 1 was scheduled to begin on April Fools\u2019 Day; so has Easter been reserved for a nice surprise from JC?

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest ever election has started in India, with voters in 20 states casting their ballots in the first phase of a marathon six-week poll. The contest in the vast country of 1.3 billion people is dominated by local issues but also viewed as a referendum on the prime minister, Narendra Modi, a staunch Hindu nationalist who rode a wave of popularity five years ago to become the first leader of a majority government in decades. Polls are now open in 91 seats, about a sixth of the total in the Indian parliament\u2019s lower house, with six more voting days to be held before the results are announced on 23 May. Modi encouraged Indians in a tweet on Thursday to \u201cturn out in record numbers and exercise their franchise\u201d, singling out the 45 million young people who have been added to the voter rolls since 2014. The districts voting on Thursday include parts of north India\u2019s \u201ccow belt\u201d, the agrarian states that Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) swept in 2014 but where it is expected to shed seats this time. It will seek to make up those numbers in states such as West Bengal, parts of which are also voting today, and where the BJP\u2019s message of Hindu unity, muscular foreign policy and pro-business reform has met with greater resistance from powerful regional parties. India\u2019s phased election process allows federal security personnel to be shuttled around the country to secure the integrity of a contest involving up to 900 million eligible voters, more than the next five largest democracies combined. Voters will make their choice using machines that display a paper record of their selection that is then stored in an attached locked box. Their fingers are marked with indelible ink to prevent anyone voting twice. Symbols and pictures are displayed next to candidates\u2019 names to aid the country\u2019s estimated 266 million illiterate citizens. At a public school-turned-voting station in Noida, a city that borders Delhi, voters arrived throughout the morning by car, motorcycle and rickshaw. Their IDs were checked at a booth decked in an elaborate pink lace curtain, marking the polling station out as one staffed entirely by women. \u201cThis country is better off in all fields [under Modi],\u201d said a surgeon who gave his name as Bhoj. \u201cEarlier we used to live under a scary environment, with politicians in nexus with criminals and terrorists. The feel-good factor is back.\u201d A \u201cselfie point\u201d had been erected in front of the station, encouraging voters to take pictures showing their ink-marked fingers. \u201cBasically, I\u2019m seriously concerned about the country descending into fascism,\u201d said another man after emerging from the school. \u201cAll the institutions are being centralised under one man\u2019s control.\u201d He declined to give his name. Kashmir plays at the polls The first weeks of campaigning were overshadowed by a car bombing in February that killed 40 paramilitaries in disputed Kashmir and triggered the first aerial dog-fights and airstrikes between India and Pakistan in half a century. Polls in the aftermath of those clashes suggest they played to Modi\u2019s advantage and temporarily took the focus off issues where he is thought to be more vulnerable, such as the inability of the Indian economy to create formal jobs and plummeting incomes in the country\u2019s debt-ridden farming sector. At BJP rallies across the country, campaigners including Modi have emphasised the government\u2019s response to the car bombing in Pulwama, a southern Kashmir district, and condemned opposition figures who questioned the official narrative that India destroyed a terrorist training camp in the Pakistani town of Balakot. \u201cI want to ask first-time voters: can your first vote be dedicated to the courageous jawans [soldiers] who did the Balakot airstrike?\u201d Modi told a rally in Maharashtra on Tuesday, in remarks that his critics said politicised the military. \u201cCan your first vote be in the name of the courageous martyrs who lost their lives in Pulwama?\u201d The main opposition Congress party has made social policies the centrepiece of its campaign, especially its minimum income guarantee, a plan to top up the bank accounts of the poorest fifth of the country with 6,000 rupees (\u00a367) per month. Crucial to the result will be the performance of India\u2019s powerful regional parties, some of which have set aside ideological and personal differences to form unlikely alliances aimed at limiting the growth of the BJP in their states. An alliance of the two main regional parties in Uttar Pradesh, for example, is expecting to dent the BJP\u2019s returns in the crucial state. The anti-Modi factor The Congress party\u2019s path back to power will lie in forming an anti-Modi alliance with several of these regional parties, but that could be difficult to stitch and hold together, said Rahul Verma, an analyst. \u201cFor many of these regional parties, their principal opposition is Congress, and their existence depends on the decline of Congress,\u201d he said. A BJP campaign official in West Bengal told the Guardian he believed his party had the edge in terms of party workers on the ground but that no side was dominating the contest. \u201cThe wind is not blowing any way so far,\u201d he said, on condition of anonymity. He said Modi had enjoyed a honeymoon after the airstrikes against Pakistan but that other issues were now becoming more prominent in voters\u2019 minds. \u201cPulwama is an old story and people won\u2019t buy it for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a shelf life.\u201d Kamal Gupta, a businessman from Almora, an Uttarakhand state district that votes on Thursday, said the election campaign had been muted compared with the last one, in 2014. \u201cThis time there is no noise, it is very dull,\u201d he said. \u201cI will vote for Modi,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has shown his boldness and seriousness in handling India\u2019s crisis during the Pulwama attack.\u201d In West Bengal, posters for the regional ruling party, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), duelled for space with those of the BJP. \u201cWe are fed up with the TMC,\u201d said Raju Sarkar, a driver from Alipurduar district who voted on Thursday. \u201cIt does nothing for the people: no plans or schemes. But look at BJP, it has so many schemes like Save and Educate Girl Child,\u201d he said, referring to a Modi government policy aimed at curbing the mortality rates of girls. Two party workers were killed on Thursday in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, the site of a bitter electoral contest between the regional Telugu Desam party and the YSR Congress, an affiliate of national Congress party. There were also complaints that electronic voting machines were breaking down in the state as well as in Maharashtra on India\u2019s west coast. Thousands of police and paramilitary officers were deployed in constituencies in Kashmir that also voted on Thursday after weeks of low-key campaigning. \u201cI had to cast my vote, for our security and dignity,\u201d said Ghulam Mohammad Wani, a voter outside a polling station in Sumbal, a town in Baramulla district. \u201cThere is so much oppression on Muslims outside. Narendra Modi said democracy, humanity, but everything turned out to be lie. Cow was given a better position than humans.\u201d Kakoli Bhattacharya contributed to this report from Bangalore and Azhar Farooq from Srinagar",
