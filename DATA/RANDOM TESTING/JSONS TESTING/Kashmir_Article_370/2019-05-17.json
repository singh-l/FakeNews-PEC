      "bodyText": "Campaigning in the most acrimonious election in recent Indian history has ended with an admonishment by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, of some of his hardline candidates for praising Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s assassin. A six-week campaign dominated by national security issues and increasingly brazen rhetoric came to a head this week after a candidate for Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) in Madhya Pradesh state said she believed Gandhi\u2019s killer, Nathuram Godse, was \u201ca patriot\u201d. She later apologised. Three other BJP members also weighed in on Gandhi\u2019s murder. Meanwhile, in the crucial state of West Bengal campaigning was brought to an unprecedented early end on Thursday after street fights broke out between BJP supporters and those of a bitter rival, the West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee. About 60 million people are eligible to vote in the seventh and final round of voting on Sunday, and the results of the entire contest will be released progressively throughout the day from 7am on Thursday. Modi, who ordinarily avoids commenting on controversial remarks by members of his Hindu nationalist party, said in a TV interview on Friday that \u201cthe comments on Gandhi and Godse are deplorable, disgusting and are not language fit for civilised society\u201d. Godse\u2019s deadly resentment of Gandhi for supposedly indulging Muslim demands in the years leading to India\u2019s independence has existed on the fringes of India\u2019s Hindu nationalist movement for decades. In recent years, however, those fringes have become more powerful. In the frantic final hours of campaigning on Friday, Modi announced he would hold his first press conference in India since being elected five years ago. But after speaking briefly at the event at about 5pm, he declined to answer any questions. His main opponent, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party, used his final press conference of the campaign to criticise election authorities for curtailing campaigning in West Bengal state, arguing the suspension was tailored to coincide with Modi\u2019s last campaign rally in the state. Modi wields the largest parliamentary majority of any leader in decades, but started the year looking vulnerable, having struggled to deliver on promises to create tens of millions of jobs and double the incomes of Indian farmers, a crucial constituency in a country where nearly 50% of people are employed in agriculture. That changed on 14 February, when a Kashmiri militant drove a car laden with explosives into an army convoy, killing 40 paramilitaries. India retaliated by striking targets inside Pakistan, which hit back the following day, bringing the countries closer to all-out war than they had been in two decades. India\u2019s retaliation \u2013 in contrast to the \u201cstrategic restraint\u201d policy of the previous government \u2013 became a major theme of the early campaign. Modi has styled himself as the national \u201cchowkidar\u201d, or watchman. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been an election so much about national security in three or four decades,\u201d said Rajat Sethi, a BJP campaign strategist. The main opposition Congress party has sought to shift the focus to social issues, campaigning hard on promises to guarantee the country\u2019s poorest citizens a 72,000-rupee (\u00a3800) annual income and to double healthcare spending in the next five years. Gandhi has portrayed Modi as an authoritarian whose government bullies and neglects the country\u2019s 300 million people from religious minorities. \u201cModi\u2019s politics is divisive,\u201d said Sam Pitroda, a Congress elder. \u201cModi\u2019s politics is fear.

The BJP president, Amit Shah, told a rally in Assam state in April that if re-elected the BJP would rid India of unauthorised migrants \u2013 except for Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. The BJP has defended its record on minority issues, arguing that previous governments pretended to favour Muslims to win their votes, but failed to deliver on improving their livelihoods. Though dozens of Muslims and low-caste Hindus have been killed in high-profile lynchings, instances of large-scale religious riots have declined, said the defence minister, Nirmala Sitharaman. \u201cExcept for very few instances there have been no instances of communal rioting,\u201d she told reporters in Delhi last week. \u201cFive years have gone without any major incidents.\u201d Polls \u2013 considered harder to conduct reliably than in the west \u2013 broadly show the BJP is likely to be the largest party in parliament but will fall short of a majority and need to form coalitions to govern.
