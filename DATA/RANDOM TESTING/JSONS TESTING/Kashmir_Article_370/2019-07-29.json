Or so goes the story that has become the core of Narendra Modi\u2019s extraordinary appeal.</p>\n    <p>Modi was born in 1958 to a poor family in western India\u2019s Gujarat state, where he developed a strong dislike for the ruling Congress party as a result of hanging around a political office near his father\u2019s tea stall.</p>\n    <p>While still a child, he started attending daily meetings of the <a href=\"http://rss.org/\">Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh</a>, said to be the world\u2019s largest volunteer organisation, whose Hindu nationalist ideology envisions the country\u2019s diverse Hindu population as a single nation with a sacred culture that should be given primacy in India.</p>\n    <p>Hindu nationalists were sidelined by India\u2019s founding prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/may/01/greatspeeches\">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, whose vision of India was of a secular nation at ease with its bewildering plurality. Their parties, including Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), struggled to win more than 10% of the national vote for decades until the 1990s, when they started to expand on the back of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/28/ayodhya-mosque-india-guardian-report\">national campaign to demolish a 16th-century Mughal mosque</a> and replace it with a Hindu temple.</p>\n    <p>BJP\u2019s support was limited to wealthier Hindus in the country\u2019s north and west, with resistance to the party from poor, marginalised Hindus, Muslims and south Indians thought to be permanent hurdles to Hindu nationalist domination.</p>\n    <p>Modi\u2019s magnetism, especially his personal branding as a tea boy who climbed to the country\u2019s highest ranks, has changed those calculations, drawing vast support from the country\u2019s emerging middle and lower-middle classes. Young Indians had grown up being told their country was on the cusp of becoming a superpower. In Modi they had a leader who spoke as if it already was.</p>\n    <p>Alongside aspiration, the BJP promotes a vision of Hindu cultural supremacy that sidelines the country\u2019s 300m minority population. As chief minister of Gujarat state, Modi was a firebrand Hindutva campaigner. In 2002, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre\">anti-Muslim riots in his state killed at least 1,000 people</a>, resulting in the future prime minister becoming an international pariah who was banned from entering the US.</p>\n    <p>In response, Modi presented himself as an outsider being attacked by elites: a refrain that would become a central part of his political messaging, that he was constantly being targeted by the English-speaking media out of Delhi.</p>\n    <p>When popular disgust at corruption scandals plaguing the previous Congress government boiled over into street protests in 2011, it provided the rightwing populist leader a national springboard. His mastery of political theatre, and finger on the pulse of Indians, has now secured him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/23/india-election-results-narendra-modi-bjp-victory\">the strongest mandate of any leader in decades</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\">Michael Safi</a></b>&nbsp;<i>in Delhi</i><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Bhavreen Kandhari, an Extinction Rebellion activist in India, said Modi\u2019s pro-business, pro-development government contributes to India\u2019s environmental destruction.

The News Corp paper claimed that the Threatened Species Recovery Hub was an \u201canti-coal group\u201d made up of \u201cgreenies\u201d who had been \u201chand-picked by the Palaszczuk government to review one of the mine\u2019s environmental management plans\u201d.

The newspaper published an opinion piece by the deputy director of the Hub on 22 February 2019 which was a robust defence of scientific practice. It also said the Hub did not request that it be able to respond in the opinion piece more generally to the article. The Press Council requires publications to take reasonable steps to ensure factual material is accurate and not misleading (general principle 1) and presented with reasonable fairness and balance (general principle 3).

      "bodyText": "The defamation case between BuzzFeed and Emma Husar will not proceed to a trial after the two parties reached an out-of-court settlement. The court heard on Monday that the former Labor MP\u2019s case against the online publisher over an article which she said portrayed her as \u201ca slut\u201d and \u201csexually perverted\u201d had reached settlement. The former western Sydney MP is suing BuzzFeed Australia, its American parent company BuzzFeed Inc and the former BuzzFeed journalist Alice Workman. In a case management hearing, Husar\u2019s lawyer, Sandy Dawson SC, told the court \u201cthe matter has settled and the form of the deed has now been agreed\u201d. But detail over the settlement will wait until next week, because of what Dawson called a \u201ccrossing of wires\u201d between the two parties. \u201cThe delay is in the execution of the document by the respondent, I\u2019m told that the CEO and the CFO for BuzzFeed in America will be executing the document on behalf of the respondent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Ms Workman who is a respondent is expected to execute today.\u201d Husar launched defamation proceedings against BuzzFeed in December of last year over what she described as a \u201cslut-shaming\u201d story that led to her announcing she would not recontest her seat at the next election. Husar said she was defamed in an article, a tweet and a Facebook post in August outlining misconduct allegations made against her and examined as part of a confidential internal Labor investigation. She said the article claimed she had bragged about her sexual relations, sexually harassed an employee and exposed herself to a colleague and his infant son. The article, she said, included a number of false and defamatory allegations about her including that she was \u201ca slut who boasts about who she has had sex with, which includes other members of parliament and members of her staff\u201d. \u201cI am not a bully, I am not Sharon Stone, I am not a thief and I did not deliberately misuse my work expenses,\u201d she said, referencing the Hollywood star widely associated with a \u201csexually graphic film scene\u201d, she said in parliament in December. BuzzFeed had argued it did not use the word \u201cslut\u201d, and denied the imputations. It maintained a truth defence to other allegations including that Husar is \u201csexually perverted\u201d and \u201cengaged in inappropriate sexualised behaviour toward her staff\u201d.",
