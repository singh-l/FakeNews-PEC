Almost one in five people who undergo either procedure, or have acupuncture or electrolysis, suffer some sort of health setback as a result, according to a new report by the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH). Risks range from experiencing swelling of the skin to infections including HIV and hepatitis and even developing the potentially fatal condition sepsis, it reports. A gap in the law means that the fast-growing number of tattooists and other practitioners offering such procedures do not have to be qualified in the stringent infection control needed to safely operate such premises. \u201cWithin the law and within the boundaries of consent people should not be prevented from expressing themselves by changing their body. But there need to be protections in place to ensure that infection control and other health risks are minimised,\u201d said Shirley Cramer, the RSPH\u2019s chief executive. Just under a fifth (18%) of those who have had a tattoo, piercing, acupuncture or electrolysis in the past five years have suffered a side-effect such as burning or swelling, according to a survey of 2,000 people in May and June by Populus. The number of tattoo parlours in the UK rose by 173% between 2000 and 2014 and one in five people now has a tattoo. However, the RSPH wants ministers to legislate to ensure that all premises providing procedures in which the skin barrier is broken must have a qualification in infection control as a condition of getting a licence from the council. The NHS\u2019s top doctor said the risks associated with the trend towards \u201cbody modification\u201d meant tighter controls are needed. \u201cGetting a tattoo or piercing might appear cool, but ending up with hepatitis or sepsis certainly isn\u2019t,\u201d said Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s medical director. \u201cThe NHS will always be there for anyone who needs it, but shouldn\u2019t be left to pick up the pieces from dodgy tattoo parlours who don\u2019t take infection control seriously. \u201cAll organisations involved need to take their responsibilities seriously, particularly [with] young people, and higher standards are long overdue.\u201d In November 2015 an unlicensed tattooist in Peterborough called Vladislav Laputs was jailed for 16 weeks after admitting breaches of health and safety laws intended to protect his customers\u2019 safety.
