      "bodyText": "A bullish Boris Johnson has sought to reassure Tory MPs queasy about his plan to suspend parliament by announcing he wants to \u201cstep up the tempo\u201d of Brexit talks in Brussels. After his chief negotiator, David Frost, met EU officials in Brussels on Wednesday, the prime minister said on Thursday that both sides had agreed to meet twice a week. \u201cI have said right from my first day in office that we are ready to work in an energetic and determined way to get a deal done. While I have been encouraged with my discussions with EU leaders over recent weeks that there is a willingness to talk about alternatives to the anti-democratic backstop, it is now time for both sides to step up the tempo,\u201d Johnson said. Downing Street is gearing up to resist efforts by MPs, lawyers and campaigners to frustrate his suspension of parliament. Johnson\u2019s team face a battle on several fronts, with the Scottish court of session due to rule on Friday on whether proroguing parliament is unconstitutional and MPs drawing up plans to legislate against a no deal. Downing Street believes it can defeat the legal challenge, if necessary in the supreme court, and it will use every parliamentary tactic available to frustrate the rebel MPs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear before that we will deliver Brexit by any means necessary and that remains the case,\u201d said one Downing Street source. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, acting for a cross-party group of 75 MPs and peers, told the Scottish court of session in Edinburgh that Johnson had trampled on more than 400 years of constitutional law by asking the Queen to prorogue parliament solely for political gain. \u201cWe have a constitution ruled by law,\u201d O\u2019Neill told Lord Doherty, urging him to issue an interdict \u2013 a Scottish court order equivalent to an injunction \u2013 forcing the UK government to quash the prorogation order signed by the Queen on Wednesday. Whitehall sources said the government was \u201cpretty confident of our case\u201d and would pursue it to the supreme court \u201cif for some reason the judgment went the other way\u201d. Johnson\u2019s ruthless approach was underlined on Thursday evening when the chancellor\u2019s media adviser was abruptly sacked. It is understood the special adviser, who had previously worked for Sajid Javid\u2019s predecessor as chancellor, Philip Hammond, was dismissed on the spot by the prime minister\u2019s aide, Dominic Cummings, and escorted out of Downing Street. The dismissal followed the last-minute cancellation of a speech planned for Wednesday by Javid and comes a few days ahead of a critical spending review. However, cracks appeared on Thursday in the government\u2019s careful public justification for the suspension of parliament when the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was caught on mic at a meeting in Helsinki on Thursday. Wallace, a longtime ally of Johnson, said: \u201cParliament has been very good at saying what it doesn\u2019t want. It has been awful at saying what it wants. That\u2019s the reality. So eventually any leader has to, you know, try.\u201d He continued: \u201cOur system is a winner-takes-all system. If you win a parliamentary majority, you control everything, you control the timetable. There\u2019s no written separation, so \u2026 you pretty much are in command of the whole thing. And we\u2019ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority and a coalition and that\u2019s not easy for our system.\u201d Downing Street later said Wallace \u201cmisspoke\u201d. Ministers privately admit the battle to block anti-no-deal legislation in the Commons next week appears all but lost, but efforts to frustrate the rebels is focusing on the House of Lords. Opposition peers expect Tory peers to attempt to filibuster the legislation, which will need to have passed through all its parliamentary stages and received royal assent before parliament is suspended or it will fall. Johnson has already suffered one setback in the Lords as George Young quit the Tory frontbench in the upper house on Thursday in protest at the decision to suspend parliament. In his resignation letter, Lord Young, who was a minister under Margaret Thatcher, said he was \u201cvery unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation, and its motivation\u201d. He said he was not part of any \u201cremainer plot\u201d. It is unclear how Johnson would respond if an anti-no-deal bill is passed mandating him to extend article 50, but it is widely believed at Westminster that No 10 is working on plans for a general election to be held after 31 October if possible but beforehand if necessary. Cabinet ministers who have previously been outspoken in their opposition to prorogation, including Amber Rudd and Matt Hancock, have been kept onboard by the hope Johnson can strike a reworked Brexit deal. They believe the real prospect of a no-deal Brexit will strengthen his hand in the negotiations and then persuade sceptical Labour MPs to support a deal rather than risk crashing out on 31 October. According to a diplomatic note of Frost\u2019s meeting in Brussels, seen by the Guardian, Frost downplayed Johnson\u2019s suspension of parliament, describing it as normal. He told his interlocutors that Johnson wanted a deal but was not afraid of no deal. The UK government appears to be seeking to convince the EU that it can bounce parliament into accepting any rewritten deal.

From late in the evening of 4 August, landlines, mobile phones, the internet and, initially, cable TV services were all suspended. Hours later the Indian government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\">stripped away Kashmir\u2019s autonomy</a> and repealed special rules that prevented outsiders from buying land. For many Kashmiris, the move was an unimaginable betrayal. They fear it will alter the demography and traditions of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state.</p> \n<p>Across the world Kashmiris watched as TV news showed the region placed under strict curfew, with tens of thousands of extra troops deployed.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is choking. You feel helpless because there is nothing you can do,\u201d said Behisth Shabir, who is from Kashmir but lives in London.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Kashmiri communities around the world are desperately searching for ways to contact their relatives. On Facebook and WhatsApp groups, people share when they are flying back, and offer to take letters with them. A radio host in Kashmir, who had brief access to the internet, promised to relay updates, while many send text and videos to be played on Gulistan TV and other channels.</p> \n<p>Weeks have passed since Sameer Gojwari, who works in Mumbai, spoke to his family, who live in downtown Srinagar, where there are often protests. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there is medication for my family, we have small kids in the family, do they have food?\u201d he said, adding that his grandfather had heart problems and his grandmother was diabetic. \u201cThey need medication and they have to visit a doctor on a monthly basis that is outside the city. Are they allowed to go out? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> \n<p>Across Kashmir, roadblocks and concertina wires have restricted movement.</p> \n<p>\u201cMentally [the strain] is getting bigger and bigger, day by day,\u201d said Gojwari. All he wants is to hear from his family, he said. \u201cEven [prisoners] have the right to communicate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Government phones have been made available to residents in some areas but people have to queue for hours to use them and only have minutes to speak. Some landlines have been restored, but even these remain unreliable. On Wednesday officials said mobile phone service would be restored in most of Jammu, and in two northern areas of the Kashmir valley, Kupwara and Handwara police districts. However, these are far from the main city of Srinagar, and it was not clear on Thursday whether services had resumed.</p> \n<p>Samer Afzal, who lives in Paris, has spoken to her mother twice over recent weeks, through her aunt\u2019s landline. Each call has to be meticulously planned because her aunt lives in a different neighbourhood and cannot ring international numbers.</p> \n<p>A few days ago she tried to wish her mother a happy birthday. \u201cShe quickly hung up. She said: \u2018OK fine, we don\u2019t have much time to get back home and it\u2019s already dark,\u2019\u201d said Afzal, who worries about relatives making the journey back across the city. \u201cWhenever I am able to [call] this stress [is] over me.

      "bodyText": "Staff at Gulistan TV have lost count of how many messages have flooded in over recent weeks. Every day, texts from viewers are broadcast across a banner at the bottom of the channel\u2019s screen. Some are written by young people away studying at college, others are from Kashmiris travelling in India, or who have settled abroad. The channel, which broadcasts to Kashmir from Delhi, is one of the few ways people can send messages home. \u201cBaha Ali, Imran and me all are OK and doing good,\u201d reads one message, sent in English. \u201cHope u all will be fine there especially Mummy in Munwara.\u201d Another, from Farhat, whose family are in north Kashmir, reads: \u201cPlz Papa contact me as soon as possible.\u201d Many will not receive a response. It is nearly four weeks since millions of people in the state of Jammu and Kashmir were cut off from the world. From late in the evening of 4 August, landlines, mobile phones, the internet and, initially, cable TV services were all suspended. Hours later the Indian government stripped away Kashmir\u2019s autonomy and repealed special rules that prevented outsiders from buying land. For many Kashmiris, the move was an unimaginable betrayal. They fear it will alter the demography and traditions of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. Across the world Kashmiris watched as TV news showed the region placed under strict curfew, with tens of thousands of extra troops deployed. \u201cIt is choking. You feel helpless because there is nothing you can do,\u201d said Behisth Shabir, who is from Kashmir but lives in London. She spoke to her parents after some landlines were restored last weekend but remains unable to call her husband\u2019s family. Kashmiri communities around the world are desperately searching for ways to contact their relatives. On Facebook and WhatsApp groups, people share when they are flying back, and offer to take letters with them. A radio host in Kashmir, who had brief access to the internet, promised to relay updates, while many send text and videos to be played on Gulistan TV and other channels. Weeks have passed since Sameer Gojwari, who works in Mumbai, spoke to his family, who live in downtown Srinagar, where there are often protests. \u201cI don\u2019t know if there is medication for my family, we have small kids in the family, do they have food?\u201d he said, adding that his grandfather had heart problems and his grandmother was diabetic. \u201cThey need medication and they have to visit a doctor on a monthly basis that is outside the city. Are they allowed to go out? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Across Kashmir, roadblocks and concertina wires have restricted movement. \u201cMentally [the strain] is getting bigger and bigger, day by day,\u201d said Gojwari. All he wants is to hear from his family, he said. \u201cEven [prisoners] have the right to communicate.\u201d Government phones have been made available to residents in some areas but people have to queue for hours to use them and only have minutes to speak. Some landlines have been restored, but even these remain unreliable. On Wednesday officials said mobile phone service would be restored in most of Jammu, and in two northern areas of the Kashmir valley, Kupwara and Handwara police districts. However, these are far from the main city of Srinagar, and it was not clear on Thursday whether services had resumed. Samer Afzal, who lives in Paris, has spoken to her mother twice over recent weeks, through her aunt\u2019s landline. Each call has to be meticulously planned because her aunt lives in a different neighbourhood and cannot ring international numbers. A few days ago she tried to wish her mother a happy birthday. \u201cShe quickly hung up. She said: \u2018OK fine, we don\u2019t have much time to get back home and it\u2019s already dark,\u2019\u201d said Afzal, who worries about relatives making the journey back across the city. \u201cWhenever I am able to [call] this stress [is] over me. I hope they reach back home safe and nobody harms them, nobody beats my brother and nobody takes him away.\u201d Over recent weeks, thousands of people have been detained, according to separate estimates collected by Agence France-Presse and Associated Press. At least 152 people have been hurt by teargas and pellets, according to data collected by Reuters. Despite heavy security, protests against Delhi\u2019s actions still frequently occur in Srinagar. Officials maintain that there have been only \u201ca few\u201d detentions, to prevent unrest, and that the situation is returning to \u201cnormalcy\u201d. Many Kashmiris are highly sceptical of government reassurances. \u201cIf everything is normal and this is a step towards progression, why were we stopped from celebrating Eid? Why can\u2019t our kids go to schools?\u201d said Shabir. Though a few schools have opened, most classrooms remain empty because parents are too afraid to send their children. The communication block and restrictions on movement have severely hampered independent reporting, and there is a lack of reliable information. Aleena Qureshi, who lives in Hyderabad, broke down and cried when her family called. \u201cWhen I heard my aunt\u2019s voice we both became very emotional,\u201d she said. \u201cMy aunt said: \u2018Everything is not OK here, [but] we are fine right now,\u2019\u201d said Qureshi. She added: \u201cI just want to see my mum, I just want to hug her.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rebel MPs from across the political spectrum are gearing up for a historic parliamentary clash next week, after Boris Johnson announced plans to suspend parliament for a critical five-week period in the run-up to Brexit. Conservative and opposition MPs took part in a series of hastily convened conference calls on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to prevent a no-deal outcome, after the prime minister confirmed he had obtained permission from the Queen to prorogue parliament. The surprise decision provoked widespread fury, with Commons Speaker John Bercow describing it as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. Robert Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said Whitehall would have to think carefully about whether to put ministers\u2019 instructions into effect. \u201cWe are reaching the point where the civil service must consider putting its stewardship of the country ahead of service to the government of the day,\u201d he said. In a letter to MPs, Johnson insisted the suspension would allow him to focus on his domestic priorities of funding the NHS and tackling violent crime, and parliament would have \u201cample\u201d time to debate Brexit \u2013 but it was widely seen as a bid to curtail MPs\u2019 chances to bind his hands. The cross-party rebel alliance agreed to focus on fast-tracking legislation aimed at mandating the prime minister to request an extension to article 50 if he fails to strike a new Brexit deal by mid-October. The fresh scramble to prevent a no-deal Brexit came on a day of extraordinary drama, as: \u2022 The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, flew to Balmoral to receive the Queen\u2019s formal approval for the prorogation plan at a meeting of the privy council. \u2022 Sterling tumbled by more than 1 cent against the US dollar, as investors interpreted Johnson\u2019s ploy as heightening the risks of a no-deal Brexit, before rallying later in the day to close 0.5 cents down. \u2022 Senior EU figures were taken aback, with the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, calling the move, \u201csinister\u201d. \u2022 A petition against the suspension of parliament rapidly exceeded 800,000 signatures. \u2022 Jeremy Corbyn protested against the move in a letter to the Queen. \u2022 Lawyers for the activist Gina Miller made an urgent application to the high court for a judicial review of the prime minister\u2019s decision. Parliament will now sit for little more than a week from 3 September, before breaking until 14 October, when a new Queen\u2019s speech will be held setting out what Johnson called \u201ca bold and ambitious domestic legislative agenda for the renewal of our country after Brexit\u201d. In practice, given MPs do not sit on most Fridays, they are only likely to lose between four and six sitting days in parliament. MPs would have been due to hold conference recess anyway, from 12 September until 7 October. But Johnson\u2019s gambit squeezes the time available for rebel MPs to act. Their numbers have been boosted by the departure from cabinet of key members of the \u201cGaukeward squad\u201d, including former chancellor Philip Hammond, who is expected to spearhead next week\u2019s efforts. \u201cAt a time of national crisis parliament must be able to meet to hold the government to account and to represent our constituents and it is profoundly undemocratic to shut parliament down to stop it doing its job,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cWe are determined parliament will show its resolve to stop a no-deal Brexit \u2026 We will have to try to do something when parliament returns next week.\u201d He could table a vote of no-confidence in Johnson\u2019s government; but Labour have repeatedly said they would not do so unless they were convinced of success \u2013 which is deemed unlikely while potential Tory rebels are focused on blocking no deal through legislation. Donald Trump waded into the row on Wednesday, fresh from showering praise on Johnson at the G7 summit in Biarritz over the weekend. The US president claimed it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d for Corbyn to win a no-confidence vote, because Johnson was \u201cexactly what the UK has been looking for\u201d. One senior Labour figure speculated that Johnson\u2019s rationale might be to show that he had been forced into a general election. \u201cBuckle up, summer\u2019s over,\u201d he said. But Downing Street insists Johnson is focused on getting a new deal with the EU; and is determined not to go to the polls before Brexit day, even if he loses a vote of no confidence. \u201cWe have been very clear that if there\u2019s a no-confidence vote, he won\u2019t resign. We get to set an election date. We don\u2019t want an election, but if we have to set a date, it\u2019s going to be after 31 October,\u201d said a senior government source. The first hint that something was afoot came when the chancellor, Sajid Javid, cancelled a major speech planned for Wednesday, announcing instead that a slimmed-down spending review will take place next week. Johnson\u2019s cabinet, which is packed with veterans of the Vote Leave campaign, were only informed of the prime minister\u2019s decision to suspend parliament in a conference call on Wednesday morning \u2013 after Johnson had already made a request to the Queen. Downing Street insisted this had been the standard approach to planning a Queen\u2019s speech for previous governments. During the conference call, the prime minister stuck resolutely to the line that the suspension was simply aimed at paving the way for his new government to press on with its domestic agenda. No dissent was expressed, the Guardian understands \u2013 though one senior Tory source said Amber Rudd was \u201cmore reserved\u201d than others. They described the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, as \u201centhusiastic as Andrea Leadsom\u201d in supporting the plan. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, faced ridicule on Twitter, with his letter to fellow candidates during the Tory leadership contest calling on them to rule out prorogation being widely shared. Hancock warned in the letter that \u201ca policy on Brexit to prorogue parliament would mean the end of the Conservative party as a serious party of government\u201d. Allies said he had been referring to the more drastic proposal of proroguing parliament through to exit day \u2013 and believes narrowing the window in which MPs can debate and vote on an improved Brexit deal could help it to pass, by sharpening the dilemma for MPs. The rebels\u2019 plan for averting a no-deal Brexit leans heavily on Bercow\u2019s assistance. In an extraordinary intervention for the Speaker, whose role demands political neutrality, Bercow said Johnson\u2019s move was a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d. \u201cHowever it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of prorogation now would be to stop parliament debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI have had no contact from the government, but if the reports that it is seeking to prorogue parliament are confirmed, this move represents a constitutional outrage.\u201d The rebels believe Bercow, who is often accused of trying to thwart Brexit by Eurosceptic MPs, will grant a request for an emergency backbench debate \u2013 known as an SO24 \u2013 on the the first day parliament returns, 3 September. An amendable motion could then be voted on in a matter of days. If successful it would pass to the Lords who would be required to sit in emergency sessions over the weekend of 7 and 8 September. It must have received royal assent before parliament is prorogued, or the Commons would have to start again from scratch when parliament returns on 14 October. One former Conservative cabinet minister suggested a key rationale for the government\u2019s approach was that, by convention, the Queen\u2019s speech is debated for six days \u2013 clogging up the timetable to prevent wrecking manoeuvres. \u201cThey have worked through the options and decided this is their only reasonably safe option for delivery on 31 October,\u201d he said. Johnson said MPs would get the opportunity to vote on the outcome of the key 17 October European council meeting, at which he hopes a new Brexit deal will be agreed, during the following week, on 21 and 22 October \u2013 little more than a week before exit day. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 August 2019. An earlier version suggested that Philip Hammond was among cabinet members who were sacked. In fact he resigned.",
