I\u2019d hate to be the lawyer that has to figure all that out. It\u2019s all academic though, Jon doesn\u2019t want to be king and I think it\u2019ll all be solved by next episode. The big disappointment over the last season and this episode is that Tyrion has just become a bit of a paperweight. When even Sansa is just there like: \u201cWtf are you on about you fool,\u201d you know you\u2019ve got problems. Shame to see where his character has ended up. All in all an okay episode. Almost disappointing really considering there\u2019s so few left and this one didn\u2019t really do much new, but kinda just put everything where we knew it was going. <em><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/128078217\">Cropolite</a></em></p> <h2>\u2018Loved it but I was always going to\u2019</h2> <p>Loved it, but then again I was always going to. The last moment was excellent, and I really enjoyed the sheer volume of awkwardness they managed to wring out of many of the reunions. The Night King\u2019s patterns and symbols have been a part of the show since the very first scene. We saw them again at the Fist of the First Men with the horses\u2019 heads, and were reminded of them last year at the dragonglass caves with Jon and Dany. It\u2019s just how they roll. <em><a href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/128075693\">sarahfin</a></em></p> <h2>\u2018Jaime and Bran. Enough said\u2019</h2> <p>It did not break as much ground as I expected. Did the long wait and the hype raise our expectations as big as the Wall? I think so. The opening scene was well set. However as it progressed it sometimes fell flat. Cersei was wonderfully cunning as usual. Daenerys seems to be having opposition from all sides. Poor Tyrion seemed to be at a loss for words while Sansa has certainly learned a lot. Arya and Gendry seemed to be forced into flirting. And the Night King did all of that? Seems to be a waste of time when you have a dragon and a huge army of the dead with you. Still the episode as a whole feels like a prelude to something bigger, better and horrifying. Oh. And the end. Jaime and Bran. Enough said. <em>Abraham Eapen John, 27, doctor, India</em></p> <h2><em> </em>\u2018Game of Thrones is at its best when characters are talking in rooms\u2019</h2> <p>I loved it. As much as Game of Thrones has become about the spectacle, the budget and enormous battles, when it is at its best is when characters are talking in rooms. It\u2019s the political positioning and standoffs that made me fall in love with the show in the first place. Well, this episode had plenty of talking (and other things, Cersei).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/15/game-of-thrones-recap-season-eight-episode-one-the-end-is-now\">Game of Thrones recap: season eight, episode one \u2013 the end is now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was always going to be a difficult episode; the expectation and hype for this season, the necessity to pull off huge emotional moments that fans have been waiting for without simply giving them lip service \u2013 I think they surpassed these and more (that look between Bran and Jaime). All I can think is that final art installation by the Night King is a reminder that a lot of characters that we\u2019ve invested time to care about are going to die in a very short space of time. <em>Jonny, 30, teacher, Manchester</em></p> <h2>\u2018Bran was oh-so-untactful and hilarious\u2019</h2> <p>It was an OK episode. I wasn\u2019t expecting greatness, as a lot of it was always going to be all the inevitable reunions and getting all the characters where they needed to be. What if it wasn\u2019t Cersei who ordered Bronn to kill the Brothers Lannister? What if it was Qyburn acting of his own volition, doing \u2018what needed to be done\u2019 as he suspected Cersei wouldn\u2019t want Jaime dead? Can\u2019t take credit for this as it was my partner\u2019s suggestion, but to me it would make a lot of sense. And if Bronn succeeds in killing Jaime, and Cersei were to find out Qyburn was behind it ... buh-bye, Maester Frankenstein.</p> <p>The dragon riding scene was fun, if a little silly, but I love seeing the dragons at any opportunity. I was kind of expecting them to see the army of the dead/Night King during their flight and was a bit surprised/disappointed they didn\u2019t. Bran with his oh-so-tactful \u201cBTW YOUR DRAGON IS A WIGHT NOW SOZ\u201d was hilarious. Though I felt that moment didn\u2019t do the reveal of undead Viserion justice \u2013 I guess they are saving that for when he turns up. And that little boy, undead and on fire and screaming. Seven hells. I will never sleep again.

Loved the Stark reunions and the rest \u2013 Arya/Gendry/The Hound, Sansa and Tyrion and that wonderful Jaime/Bran ending. You gotta love The North too though \u2013 I so want Drogon to slap them all with one swish of his tail. The Dead are on their way, Jon did what he had to do to give the Northerners a fighting chance and they\u2019re all utterly ungrateful, throwing so much shade Jon and Danny\u2019s way. They all needed to have seen that poor Umber boy! Sam\u2019s scenes stood out for me \u2013 a great way to set up telling Jon the truth about his lineage and just how much of a difference a more benevolent King he is to Danny\u2019s uncompromising Queen.</p> <p>I like how the Greyjoy stories were set up and wrapped up too. Theon choosing to go to (and dying at?) Winterfell seemed inevitable. Looks like Yara will defeat Euron to set up a safe space [on the Iron Islands] after the Winterfell battle, maybe. Cersei sending Bronn to kill her brothers \u2013 as ever she\u2019s got her priorities right! Oh yeah, she\u2019s so very dead! No one is going to have a happy ending (maybe Sam and Gilly) but a few will have their redemption. Great to see Edd join up with Tormund (I\u2019ve always had blue eyes) and Beric. Also \u2013 I love the dragons but where is Ghost? So much to delve into and only five episodes left!

Attempts at humour were forced and a lot of the dialogue early in the episode felt really awkward. Got better nearer to the end where there were juicier bits involving Jon\u2019s parents, the scene with Dany and Sam, the White Walker screaming kid thing and then the Jaime/Bran face-off. A pretty bad episode with some interesting bits at the end to set up the main parts of this season. <em>Luke, 20, student, Newcastle</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e807e56660693418d28e31fb159df31f6bc46b77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e807e56660693418d28e31fb159df31f6bc46b77/0_147_3048_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Deserving of a special shoutout ...

A slow starter that gave us a bit of time to remember where everyone is and what they are up to, while also shining some light on past rivalries (the Hound and Arya, Bran and Jaime). I was weirdly tense throughout the whole episode. Overall I enjoyed it. I\u2019m glad they went a more subtle route of telling us the Night King and his army are marching south \u2013 though the symbolic death of the Umber kid was up there with some of the most gruesome and chilling scenes of the show. Nods to religion will always creep me out. <em>Jamie Sugrue, 24, student, Dublin, Ireland</em></p> <h2><em> </em>\u2018The dragon ride felt very Aladdin\u2019</h2> <p>I loved it. A lot of the criticisms levelled at season 7 were to do with the pacing being ramped up to 11. This felt a bit more steady and measured, while still managing to have four or five \u2018big\u2019 moments in it. I\u2019m glad that Jon knows about his lineage this early in the season, which sets up the conflicts of interest nicely for the rest of the season. My only criticism would be that the dragon ride felt very Aladdin and corny. Hopefully now that he knows he\u2019s banged his aunt this won\u2019t be a regular occurrence (you never know with this show though). Special shoutout to Samwell Tarly (well, John Bradley) for being able to perfectly convey fury, grief, and respect all in one go. However with no major characters dying, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that the next episode is due to dispense of a much-loved character or five. Also, Ned Umber.

      "bodyText": "Liberal candidate Gladys Liu has responded to criticism about comments she made in a 2016 interview with Guardian Australia in which she said Chinese-Australians viewed LGBT issues as \u201cridiculous rubbish\u201d, saying they do not reflect her own views. \u201cI reject any suggestion the comments reported in 2016 were my own views,\u201d Liu said in a statement. \u201cAt the time I was responding to a question about comments I had received from some members of the Chinese community. \u201cI firmly support equality across our community.\u201d The Chisholm candidate was provided with a copy of the audio yesterday, before it was publicly released but did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia on Monday about her claims the report was \u201cfake\u201d. Instead, Liu provided a statement on Tuesday afternoon saying the comments were not her personal views. She also cancelled a planned interview on Sky News on Tuesday. According to political editor David Speers, the interview was cancelled \u201cafter Sky refused request to go softly and not ask any awkward questions\u201d. Liu conducted a WeChat campaign against Victoria\u2019s Safe Schools policy ahead of the 2016 election, when she was the head of the Liberal Party\u2019s Victorian community engagement committee. She told Guardian Australia at the time that the campaign helped the Liberals win Chisholm for Julia Banks. Banks has since quit the party and is running as an independent in Flinders, leaving the spot open for Liu. However Banks said on Tuesday that Liu had no involvement in her own WeChat campaign in 2016 and was more involved in the campaign for the neighbouring seat of Deakin, held by conservative Liberal MP Michael Sukkar. \u201cShe worked intensively on Michael Sukkar\u2019s campaign and her values are more aligned to the right wing conservative faction of the party,\u201d Banks told Guardian Australia. \u201cMy WeChat campaign was managed by the same people as my social media posts and I had no idea she was making these comments on WeChat. Certainly not endorsed by me; I find [Liu\u2019s comments] completely abhorrent and ridiculous. Completely misaligned to my values.\u201d Chisholm voted 61.6% in favour of marriage equality in the 2017 postal survey, while Deakin voted 65.7% in favour. Sukkar disputed Banks\u2019s claim, saying Liu did \u201can outstanding job on the Chisholm campaign at the last election.\u201d \u201cShe coordinated many volunteers in the Eastern Suburbs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a Liberal Party member in the Chisholm electorate, her primary focus and formal role was in that electorate. Sukkar said his campaign did not have a WeChat account in 2016. Senior Liberal Josh Frydenberg, whose electorate of Kooyong borders Chisholm in Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs, said the comments made by Liu \u201cdon\u2019t reflect my views or Scott Morrison or the party\u2019s views\u201d. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast on Tuesday, Frydenberg was asked what action the party would take over the comments. Host Michael Rowland pointed out that Labor candidate Melissa Parke had recently dropped out of the race in Curtin after making comments that leader Bill Shorten had said did not reflect the views of the Labor party. Parke made a number of comments about Israel, including that the way Israel treated Palestine was \u201cworse than the South African system of apartheid\u201d. But Frydenberg said he would not disendorse Liu, saying she was \u201ca strong local candidate\u201d. \u201cThe point is we, as a party, stand for tolerance, we, as a party and as a government have presided over the same-sex marriage debate which ended successfully,\u201d he said. It was in an interview for the 2016 Guardian Australia article that Liu said a lot of Chinese-Australians opposed the Safe Schools policy and same-sex marriage, saying \u201cChinese believe same-sex is against normal practice\u201d. \u201cChinese people come to Australia because they want ... good things for their next generation, not to be destroyed \u2013 they used the word destroyed \u2013 by these sort of concepts, of same-sex, transgender and inter-gender, cross gender, and all of this rubbish,\u201d she said. \u201cTo them they are just ridiculous rubbish.\u201d Liu made similar comments to the Age in 2016, saying that Safe Schools undermined conservative Chinese values and \u201cwe are concerned it will change society and the moral standard [of] the culture\u201d. Guardian Australia released the audio after Liu told the Australian she had been misrepresented by the article. Liu\u2019s campaign is still active on WeChat and largely shares messages of support from volunteers and members of the Chinese community in Chisholm. In one post, the mother of an international student who was the victim of a violent home invasion in Ormond in 2016 thanked Liu for supporting the students and rallying media interest in the story, which was picked up as part of coverage around the Apex gang. The post indicated Liu would continue to campaign on the \u201cAfrican gangs\u201d issue. Both African gangs and abolishing Safe Schools were key policies for the Victorian Liberal party in the November state election, which resulted in a Coalition wipeout.",
