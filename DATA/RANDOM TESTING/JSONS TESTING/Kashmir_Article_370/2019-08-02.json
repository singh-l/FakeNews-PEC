Officials said they had recovered a Pakistani-made mine, as well as ammunition, explosives and other weapons, after intelligence suggested attacks were planned on routes used by the hundreds of thousands of people trekking to the Amarnath cave. Kashmir\u2019s home secretary, Shaleen Kabra, said in a statement: \u201cIn the interest of safety and security of the tourists and Amarnath Yatris [pilgrims], it is advised that they may curtail their stay in the [Kashmir] valley immediately.\u201d It follows India\u2019s announcement last week that it would deploy an extra 10,000 troops in Kashmir, which caused panic in the disputed region.

An insurgency has waxed and waned on the Indian-administered side for three decades, and tens of thousands of people have been killed. On Friday, an improvised explosive device hit an Indian army vehicle in southern Pulwama district while a gunfight raged in nearby Shopian district. A series of orders leaked last week caused alarm in the region. One told Indian Railways staff in the Kashmir valley to stock enough dry rations to last four months and referred to a \u201cforecast of deteriorating situation\u201d. The influx of 10,000 extra troops also prompted rumours that Delhi may be preparing to scrap Kashmir\u2019s special status, which prohibits people from outside of the state from buying land in the disputed territory. \u201cThe deployment of troops is a very significant move, and this usually happens when the government is anticipating a law and order situation,\u201d said Khalid Shah, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. \u201cThere is a significant degree of panic among the people because they have no clarity on what is really going to happen.\u201d Umar, a state government employee who was willing to be identified only by his first name, said people were living in a state of uncertainty.

Amid the confusion, residents have rushed to ATMs to withdraw money and long queues have formed outside petrol stations. Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has promised to scrap article 35A of the Indian constitution, which protects the demography of Muslim-majority Kashmir by prohibiting non-state subjects from buying land. However, analysts say doing so would almost certainly trigger unrest and reignite tensions with Pakistan, and that the government would be unlikely to take such action during the Amarnath Yatra, which ends in mid-August.
