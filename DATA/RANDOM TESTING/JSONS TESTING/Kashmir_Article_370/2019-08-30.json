      "bodyText": "Guardian Australia has won the digital history prize in the New South Wales premier\u2019s history awards for its Indigenous massacres project, The Killing Times. The collaborative series with the University of Newcastle\u2019s colonial massacres research team found there were at least 270 frontier massacres over 140 years as part of a state-sanctioned and organised attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people. The Killing Times documented the history of Australia\u2019s frontier wars through the development of an interactive map showing every verifiable site of frontier conflict in the process of colonisation, from 1788 to 1930. To create the map, Guardian Australia\u2019s team refined, extended and analysed the University of Newcastle\u2019s dataset and, using the same strict research methods, identified an additional 15 sites in Western Australia, and published the first full picture of the continent\u2019s Indigenous massacres. The map is the first of its kind to be produced by any media outlet, and uniquely can be searched by date, time, location, postcode, perpetrator group and/or death count. Judges of the history awards said: \u201cThe Killing Times makes a profoundly important contribution to history and public debate in Australia. \u201cIt harnesses the capacity of interactive technology to open up the contested political space of the \u2018history wars\u2019 and shows the power of technology to sweep aside national myths to reveal a violent and quotidian world of fatal clashes between Indigenous Australians and settlers. \u201cBy pairing contemporary sources with cutting edge technology, the creators of The Killing Times have produced a resource that challenges, provokes and demands more from Australians.\u201d Guardian Australia\u2019s Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, led the project, with its data editor, Nick Evershed, developer Andy Ball, the reporter Paul Daley, the photo editor, Carly Earl, and interns Ciaran O\u2019Mahoney and Jeremy Nadal contributing. After the awards Allam said: \u201cThis prize highlights the role of the media in telling the truth about our nation\u2019s history.\u201d The Australian history prize was awarded to Meredith Lake for The Bible: A Cultural History.
