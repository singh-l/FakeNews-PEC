Rebel Conservatives believe there are now enough MPs across the House of Commons to pass an amendment that would require May to extend article 50 rather than allow the UK to leave without a deal. At least four cabinet ministers, almost a dozen junior ministers and many others on the government payroll are understood to be prepared to back the motion proposed by the Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper, due to be debated on Wednesday. A senior source close to those plotting the rebellion said there was no way the members of the government would resign voluntarily and May would have to sack them. The move comes with moderates emboldened by the formation of the Independent Group, which some see as providing leverage to push back against the influence of the European Research Group of hardline Brexiters. The cabinet ministers David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell told the prime minister in a private meeting earlier this week that she would have to delay Brexit if there was no Commons majority for her deal by 27 February. Speaking in Edinburgh on Thursday, Mundell told an audience he would do \u201ceverything I can and whatever I deem necessary to prevent a no-deal Brexit\u201d, and refused repeatedly to rule out resigning from the cabinet if necessary. May has already survived two rounds of resignations by the Brexit-supporting cabinet ministers David Davis, Boris Johnson, Esther McVey and Dominic Raab, but a wave of sackings would plunge the government into crisis at a crucial time for the Brexit talks. Pro-Brexit MPs said the outcome of next week was unpredictable but, if it came to the vote, May would have to get rid of the rebellious ministers. One cabinet source said: \u201cIt would be a huge mistake not to sack them. It would be effectively conceding we had lost control of the party.\u201d To avert a crisis, No 10 is racing to secure changes to May\u2019s withdrawal deal with the EU that will satisfy hardline Eurosceptics and the Democratic Unionist party, enabling parliament to approve it.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick summary: The flash eurozone PMIs for February suggested the bloc\u2019s economy is close to stagnation, held back by a contracting manufacturing sector The FTSE 100 has been the worst performer compared with its European peers, and is currently down 67 points or 0.9% at 7,161 Centrica is topping the FTSE\u2019s loser board today, with shares hitting a 16-year low after the parent company of British Gas reported a sharp fall in customers and warned profits this year would be hit by the energy price cap There was a big upside surprise in the UK public finances figures for January, which showed a record monthly surplus of \u00a314.9bn, in a gift to chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of his spring statement on 13 March US weekly jobless claims fell last week, but there was disappointing data on durable goods, which indicated a slowdown in the amount being spent by firms Meanwhile the US flash PMI\u2019s for February showed that growth in services ticked up, offsetting slowing growth in manufacturing Wall Street opened lower, and losses have since widened On that note it\u2019s time to close up for the day. Thank you for all the comments, and please join us again tomorrow. AM Some more upbeat US data just out, as a pick-up in services growth in February offset slowing growth in the manufacturing sector. Here are the headline numbers in the IHS Markit PMIs, where anything above 50 signals growth: Services: 56.2 in Feb (54.2 in Jan) Manufacturing: 53.7 in Feb (54.9 in Jan) Combined: 55.8 in Feb (54.4 in Jan) Tim Moore, Associate Director at IHS Markit, provides some context for the numbers: February data provides a positive signal for first quarter economic growth, with US businesses reporting the fastest output expansion since the middle of 2018. Service sector firms led the way, supported by solid improvements in business and consumer spending. Private sector payroll numbers increased to the greatest extent for five months, which adds to hopes that robust domestic demand will act as a growth tailwind over the near-term. Historical comparisons suggest the latest survey data are indicative of an underlying economic growth rate of around 2.5% annualised, although the PMI is designed to monitor private sector companies so the impact of the government shutdown may not be fully captured. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street and US markets edged lower, reflecting some disappointing economic data: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 25,918 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,779 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 7,475 Investors are digesting some gloomier US economic data, after new orders for key, American-made capital goods fell unexpectedly in December. The figures suggested business spending on machinery and metals is slowing, with orders for non-defence goods excluding aircraft down 0.7%, following a 1% fall in January. Andrew Hunter, senior US Economist at Capital Economics sums it up nicely: The December durables goods data suggest that equipment investment growth slowed further in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to remain weak for most of this year. As we await the opening bell on Wall Street - with US markets expected to open roughly flat - it\u2019s time for a recap of how it\u2019s looking across Europe. The FTSE is the biggest faller, off 62 points or 0.9%: FTSE 100: -0.9% at 7,166 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.2% at 11,419 France\u2019s CAC: -0.1% at 5,192 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -0.2% at 20,255 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.1% at 9,194 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.3% at 370 There were 216,000 new jobless claims in the US last week, down from 239,000 the week before and fewer than the 229,000 predicted by economists. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, has been speaking at the Glasgow School of Art: Purplebricks, the largest online estate agent, is having a very bad day. Rob Davies reports: Shares plunged 40% after the company slashed its revenue forecasts and announced the surprise departure of both its US and UK bosses. The company blamed slower than expected growth in its fledgling US business and \u201cheadwinds\u201d in Australia, as it said revenue for the year was unlikely to exceed \u00a3140m compared with an earlier forecast of up to \u00a3175m. The revenue prediction had already been downgraded once, at the time of its disappointing half-year results, from \u00a3185m. Shares dropped by 40% after the news but later staged a partial recovery. However they were still down 28%, at 118p, cutting the company\u2019s market value by \u00a3140m. The fall is bad news for Woodford Investment Management, led by the City investment guru Neil Woodford, which is the largest shareholder in the company, with a stake of about 27%. Purplebricks\u2019 founder and global chief executive, Michael Bruce, is to take control of the US business with immediate effect, as its US chief executive, Eric Eckardt, leaves the business. No reason was given for his departure but revenues in the US grew less rapidly than the company had hoped, after a lacklustre response to a marketing drive that finished in January. The UK chief executive, Lee Wainwright, is also leaving. The company said this was for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d. The Office for Budget Responsibility says there is still \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d about the full-year borrowing figure, despite there only being two months to go before the end of the fiscal year. Self-assessments might be weaker in February, for example, because more people paid on time, the OBR says in its monthly commentary on the latest figures. The fall in borrowing so far in 2018-19 has been somewhat greater than that in our October forecast for the full year, thanks primarily to stronger receipts growth. This reflects the effect of stronger earnings growth on PAYE and NICs receipts and, given the payment lags, stronger growth in self-assessment (SA) liabilities in 2017-18. Despite there being only two months of the fiscal year remaining, there is still significant uncertainty over the full-year figure \u2013 which itself will inevitably be revised over time. Some SA receipts will be collected in February, so the picture for this year is incomplete. HMRC administrative data for early February suggest that some of the strength in January reflected more people paying on time, so the picture for January and February together could be less strong than for January alone. Things might be looking up for Phillip Hammond in terms of the public finances, but a report published overnight by a thinktank claims government austerity policies since 2010 have left UK households \u00a3300m a month worse off. Here is our full story on those better than expected UK public finances figures: The pound is a fraction lower against the euro and the dollar following earlier gains. Sterling is off 0.1% against both currencies at \u20ac1.1494 and $1.3036. It appears that comments made by an unnamed government source are weighing on sentiment. Reuters brings this report: It does not feel like Britain will have secured the changes it needs to its exit deal with Brussels by next week, a British government source said on Thursday. Prime Minister Theresa May will hold bilateral meetings with European Union leaders at an EU-League of Arab States summit in Egypt at the weekend, but the source said she was not expected to return from that with a \u201cpiece of paper\u201d on a revised deal. If May does not bring a revised deal back to parliament for a vote by Feb. 27, lawmakers will be given the opportunity to debate and vote on the next steps, and some have said they will seek to wrestle control of the process from the government. Economists say the latest figures suggest the chancellor should comfortably undershoot the full-year borrowing target of \u00a325.5bn, with little sign so far of a Brexit impact on the public finances: John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC: So far the public finances seem to have been largely immune to the adverse effects of Brexit-related uncertainty, because this has mostly affected business investment. More tax-rich areas of economic activity, notably earnings from employment and consumer spending, have held up better over the past ten months. The budget deficit for 2018/19 as a whole now looks set to come in some way below the OBR\u2019s October budget forecast of \u00a325.2 billion, giving the chancellor some potential additional fiscal room for manoeuvre going into his Spring Statement next month. This could allow him to offer more support to the economy in the short term depending on how the Brexit negotiations progress over the next few weeks. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics: The last public finances figures released before the Spring Statement put the government on track to undershoot the OBR\u2019s forecast of borrowing of \u00a325.5bn in the 2018-19 financial year. If a Brexit deal is secured, we think that a pickup in economic growth in 2019 will increase the size of that headroom. And if there is a no deal Brexit, the chancellor should have plenty of scope to support growth, and if needed to the chancellor would sacrifice his fiscal rules for the economy. January is traditionally a surplus month for the public coffers because of the flow of income tax receipts, but this year was the strongest January since records began in 1993. Income Tax and capital gains tax receipts were \u00a321.4bn in Jan, \u00a33.1bn more than last Jan. It puts Britain\u2019s public finances on a stronger footing than at this point last year, with borrowing in the financial year so far at \u00a321.2bn, compared with \u00a339.7bn a year earlier. The forecasts for borrowing are due to be updated by the Office for Budget Responsibility (the treasury\u2019s independent forecaster) in the spring statement next month. Its current forecast is for full year borrowing (in the fiscal year ending March 2019) of \u00a325.5bn, which the treasury is now expected to undershoot. Breaking: Good news for Philip Hammond, after public finances hit a record monthly surplus of \u00a314.9bn in January thanks to strong income tax receipts. It easily beat City expectations of a \u00a310.05bn surplus, and compared with borrowing of \u00a33bn in December according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics. The figure comes just ahead of the chancellor\u2019s spring statement on 13 March. More soon... Data just out shows the eurozone economy was almost at a standstill in February. The \u2018flash\u2019 PMI surveys from IHS Markit suggest the region\u2019s manufacturing sector contracted unexpectedly this month - and for the first time in more than five years - while the services sector grew at a faster than expected rate. Taking the two together, business activity edged up over the month. Here are the headline figures for February, where anything above 50 signals growth: Flash manufacturing PMI: 49.2 (50.5 in January) Flash services PMI: 52.3 (51.2 in January) Flash eurozone composite: 51.4 (51.0 in January) Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the surveys suggests the eurozone economy is on course to grow by just 0.1% in the first quarter. The Eurozone economy remained close to stagnation in February. The flash PMI lifted only slightly higher during the month, continuing to indicate one of the weakest rates of expansion since 2014. The survey data suggest that GDP may struggle to rise by much more than 0.1% in the first quarter. The weakness is being led by manufacturing, which has now entered its first downturn since mid- 2013. With factory order books deteriorating at an increased rate, the rate of contraction in the goods- producing sector will likely worsen in coming months. At the other end of the table, Barclays is the biggest FTSE riser this morning after a pledge to return more money to investors. Shares are up 3.3% at 166p after the promise by chief executive Jes Staley, as he attempts to fend off the attentions of the activist investor Edward Bramson. Profits for 2018 were flat after litigation and conduct charges of \u00a32.2bn, while the bank also took a \u00a3150m charge to cover economic uncertainty over Brexit. Read our full story here: Shares in Centrica are down 11% this morning at 122p after the parent company of British Gas gave a very gloomy outlook for the year ahead. Profits rose in 2018 but the company lost 742,000 accounts and said profits this year would be hit by the energy price cap imposed by the regulator, Ofgem. Centrica said in its annual results statement: We have been very clear that we do not believe a price cap is a sustainable solution for the market, and is likely to have unintended consequences for customers and competition. The company has a target cashflow of \u00a32.1bn to \u00a32.3bn and met that in 2018. But Iain Conn, chief executive, warned the target would be challenging to meet this year. Julie Palmer, partner at restructuring firm Begbies Traynor, says it\u2019s a tough time for energy firms: Yes, the profits are up, but with price caps being pinned on suppliers and the precarious nature of the energy industry any expansion within the sector is a nervy and tentative process. Our \u2018red flag alert\u2019 has shown a contraction in the market with more than 3,000 utilities providers in significant financial distress \u2013 a number that increased 2% in the lead up to the Christmas period. And some smaller providers such as Utilitywise have already gone into administration in 2019. Most European markets are mainly higher this morning, following a more optimistic mood in Asia and on Wall Street. The FTSE 100 is the exception, down 25 points. More on that soon.
