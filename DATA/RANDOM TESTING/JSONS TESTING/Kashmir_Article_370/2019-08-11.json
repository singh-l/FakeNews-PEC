But the data, obtained by Guardian Australia, shows that the results are patchy across the country. In about 10% of geographic areas the number of people claiming the benefit has increased, with remote unemployment hotspots in the Northern Territory and South Australia, as well as Jimboomba and Beaudesert, south of Brisbane, among those getting worse in the past year.</p> <p><strong>The NSW government has been accused of failing to act on promises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/12/chilling-effect-on-whistleblowers-nsw-accused-of-not-acting-on-pledged-protections\">to protect whistleblowers</a> who approach the Independent Commission Against Corruption.</strong> Last week,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/07/sacked-parking-inspectors-to-test-nsw-whistleblower-protections\"> Guardian Australia revealed</a> that two western Sydney council rangers were sacked after blowing the whistle on allegations they were directed to stay away from developments owned by a local councillor.

      "bodyText": "The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, has challenged Boris Johnson to visit the city and apologise directly for once publishing an article claiming drunken fans were partly responsible for the Hillsborough tragedy, after it was reported the government was reluctant to hold a major conference in the city. Anderson said on Sunday he had offered to host what the government has billed as \u201cthe biggest ever northern powerhouse conference\u201d on 13 September after Sheffield, the initial prospective host, could not find a suitable venue. But he said his offer of the Arena and Convention Centre, which hosted last year\u2019s Labour party conference, had been turned down. It is understood Johnson has not been formally invited to the conference and No 10 rejected any suggestion he was blocking or delaying the decision. With barely a month to go, Downing Street has still not revealed where the conference will take place. It adds salt to wounds first opened up when Johnson chose Manchester as the venue for his first speech as the prime minister last month, using it to back a new high-speed rail link between Manchester and Leeds without making any mention of Liverpool. It was a \u201cshortsighted omission\u201d, said Anderson, who insisted more people currently travel by rail between Liverpool and Manchester than Manchester to Leeds. Asked if Johnson would get a \u201cwarm welcome\u201d were he to visit Liverpool, Anderson said: \u201cHe\u2019d get a hot welcome. It wouldn\u2019t be warm.\u201d Anderson said Liverpudlians had not forgotten the editorial Johnson published when he was the editor of the Spectator, in 2004, which claimed the people of Liverpool were \u201chooked on grief\u201d and blamed \u201cdrunken fans\u201d for contributing to the Hillsborough disaster of 1989 in which 96 people were killed. The Liverpool Echo had originally reported the city was being overlooked in the deliberations on who would host September\u2019s Convention of the North. \u201cThere is a feeling in the local halls of power that government simply doesn\u2019t want to come here,\u201d the paper had said. Shortly before Johnson entered Downing Street, the paper also ran a story with the headline \u201cLiverpool won\u2019t forget what prime minister hopeful Boris Johnson did\u201d. During his first prime minister\u2019s questions, Johnson refused to apologise for publishing the remarks when he was reminded of them by the Labour MP for Garston and Halewood, Maria Eagle. Back in 2012, when he was still mayor of London, Johnson had said he \u201cbitterly regretted\u201d the offence caused, but insisted he did not write the offending article. \u201cIf he came into the city and apologised directly then he might have a better chance of being given more respect, rather than just saying sorry from down south,\u201d Anderson said.

      "body": "<p>The Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, has likened the Indian government to Nazis, warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be the same as appeasing Hitler.</p> \n<p>His comments came as authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir reportedly reimposed some curfew rules in parts of the territory, following an easing of restrictions in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, that had allowed people to visit shops over the weekend and attend Friday prayers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a6ba9a1-6cf4-4c41-97ae-7af3f3152187\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Who controls Kashmir?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a>&nbsp;and Pakistan came into being in 1947.</p>\n    <p>Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \u2018line of control\u2019 based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>TV news showed footage of jeeps fitted with loudspeakers moving in the region on Sunday afternoon, telling people to return to their homes and shopkeepers to shut markets. Landlines, mobile phones and the internet all remain blocked, preventing residents from calling relatives or friends.</p> \n<p>It was not clear if people would be allowed to leave their homes for Monday\u2019s Eid-al-Adha festival, one of the biggest celebrations of the year in Kashmir.</p> \n<p>The state has been in lockdown since Monday, when the Indian government announced it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\">revoke its autonomy</a> and rules that prevent outsiders from buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris fear the move would alter the demography of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state and its traditions.</p> \n<p>Despite heavy security, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on Sunday where they chanted \u201cWhat do we want? Freedom! When do we want it? Now!\u201d. <br><strong><br></strong>On Sunday,<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/1160460575454957568\">Khan said on Twitter</a>: \u201cAttempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing. Question is: Will the world watch &amp; appease as they did Hitler at Munich?\u201d<br><br>The Pakistani prime minister added that the \u201cideology of Hindu supremacy, like the Nazi Aryan supremacy, will not stop\u201d in Kashmir, but would lead to \u201cthe suppression of Muslims in India &amp; eventually lead to targeting of Pakistan\u201d.</p> \n<p>Khan has vowed to lobby heads of states and take his complaints to the UN, though the response has so far been muted. On Sunday, he telephoned Iranian President Hassan Rouhani \u201cas part of his outreach to world leaders on the Kashmir situation\u201d, according to a statement issued by his office.</p> \n<p>Rouhani was quoted as saying that Muslims of Kashmir \u201cmust be able to use their legal rights and interests to be able to live in peace.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ufra Mir, a peace psychologist from Kashmir who has provided psycho-social support to as many as 200 Kashmiris who are living away from home, said: \u201cThis fear of uncertainty and this sense of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 this is what is really stressing people out, giving them anxiety and panic attacks.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over the past week she has counselled people through phone calls, social media and through a Whatsapp group.</p> \n<p>Many of those unable to contact their families were students away from Kashmir for the first time, she added. \u201cThey were supposed to go back home but now they don\u2019t even know if they should.

What will I do there, lock myself in a room?\u201d</p> \n<p>The communication blocks and curfew in Kashmir, which prevented people from leaving their homes for almost five days last week, were apparently intended to stop unrest, resulting in little concrete information as to what is happening in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kashmir\">Kashmir</a>.</p> \n<p>Restrictions on movement were lifted for the first time on Friday to allow people to attend local mosques for prayers.

      "bodyText": "The Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, has likened the Indian government to Nazis, warning that global inaction over Kashmir would be the same as appeasing Hitler. His comments came as authorities in Indian-administered Kashmir reportedly reimposed some curfew rules in parts of the territory, following an easing of restrictions in Srinagar, the region\u2019s main city, that had allowed people to visit shops over the weekend and attend Friday prayers. TV news showed footage of jeeps fitted with loudspeakers moving in the region on Sunday afternoon, telling people to return to their homes and shopkeepers to shut markets. Landlines, mobile phones and the internet all remain blocked, preventing residents from calling relatives or friends. It was not clear if people would be allowed to leave their homes for Monday\u2019s Eid-al-Adha festival, one of the biggest celebrations of the year in Kashmir. The state has been in lockdown since Monday, when the Indian government announced it would revoke its autonomy and rules that prevent outsiders from buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris fear the move would alter the demography of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state and its traditions. Despite heavy security, hundreds of people protested in Srinagar on Sunday where they chanted \u201cWhat do we want? Freedom! When do we want it? Now!\u201d. On Sunday, Khan said on Twitter: \u201cAttempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing. Question is: Will the world watch &amp; appease as they did Hitler at Munich?\u201d The Pakistani prime minister added that the \u201cideology of Hindu supremacy, like the Nazi Aryan supremacy, will not stop\u201d in Kashmir, but would lead to \u201cthe suppression of Muslims in India &amp; eventually lead to targeting of Pakistan\u201d. Khan has vowed to lobby heads of states and take his complaints to the UN, though the response has so far been muted. On Sunday, he telephoned Iranian President Hassan Rouhani \u201cas part of his outreach to world leaders on the Kashmir situation\u201d, according to a statement issued by his office. Rouhani was quoted as saying that Muslims of Kashmir \u201cmust be able to use their legal rights and interests to be able to live in peace.\u201d Ufra Mir, a peace psychologist from Kashmir who has provided psycho-social support to as many as 200 Kashmiris who are living away from home, said: \u201cThis fear of uncertainty and this sense of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 this is what is really stressing people out, giving them anxiety and panic attacks.\u201d Over the past week she has counselled people through phone calls, social media and through a Whatsapp group. Many of those unable to contact their families were students away from Kashmir for the first time, she added. \u201cThey were supposed to go back home but now they don\u2019t even know if they should. A lot of them have run out of money.\u201d Mir flew back on Sunday because she wanted to support her family. \u201cI don\u2019t know the space I will be going back to. I definitely know that it won\u2019t be the same, it won\u2019t be the same space that I left,\u201d she said. A few people in Kashmir have managed to secure access to a working phone to reassure family members. Mir Mushtaq, who is working in Delhi, said that his relatives called three days ago. \u201cMy mother was consistently crying. She asked me to come there and be with her,\u201d he said. Normally, he would spend Eid with family, distributing the meat of a sacrificed goat door-to-door in Pulwama, where he would visit between 100 and 180 families. He decided to stay in Delhi to raise awareness. \u201cMy motherland is in danger. What will I do there, lock myself in a room?\u201d The communication blocks and curfew in Kashmir, which prevented people from leaving their homes for almost five days last week, were apparently intended to stop unrest, resulting in little concrete information as to what is happening in Kashmir. Restrictions on movement were lifted for the first time on Friday to allow people to attend local mosques for prayers. Afterwards, police reportedly opened fire and used teargas to break up demonstrations of at least 10,000 people who took to the streets to protest Delhi\u2019s actions. An Indian home affairs ministry official denied the reports, and said there had been only a few stray protests of no more than 20 people. However, the BBC later released a video appearing to show huge crowds marching through the streets of Srinagar, as well as police opening fire and using teargas. Delhi\u2019s decision to scrap Kashmir\u2019s special status not only faces major resistance in the territory, but has also escalated tensions with Pakistan and been condemned by China. Pakistan said that with the support of China, it would take up India\u2019s actions in Kashmir with the UN security council and that it may approach the UN human rights commission over what it has described as the \u201cgenocide\u201d of the Kashmiri people. Pakistan last week expelled the Indian high commissioner and halted trade. The country\u2019s army chief warned that his forces would take any action to stand by Kashmiris. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has insisted that the removal of Kashmir\u2019s special status would bring investment and rid the state of terrorism.",

The easing of the curfew followed major protests on Friday in which at least 10,000 people reportedly took to the streets of Srinagar to demonstrate against Delhi\u2019s withdrawal of the special status accorded to India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. Police reportedly responded with teargas and rubber pellets to break up the protest, the largest to take place since the state was placed under an unprecedented communications blackout last week. An Indian home affairs ministry official called the reports \u201ccompletely fabricated and incorrect\u201d. He said: \u201cThere have been a few stray protests in Srinagar/Baramulla and none involved more than 20 people.\u201d The BBC released a video appearing to show huge crowds marching through the streets of Srinagar, carrying signs that read \u201cwe want our freedom\u201d and chanting \u201cgo back, go, India, go\u201d. The footage shows people scattering and running for cover as police appear to open fire and use teargas. The communication blackout has resulted in little concrete information as to what is happening in Kashmir. Fears have been expressed about food shortages in the state. Syed Asim Ali, who returned to Delhi from Srinagar on Thursday, said his family was low on food and had been eating dried vegetables stored as emergency supplies. \u201cThere is going to be a terrible food shortage in a few days,\u201d he said. \u201cWe managed to buy dairy supplies [from shop keepers who had closed their doors], but they were saying all the supplies from Jammu had been blocked.\u201d Baseer Khan, the senior administrative official of Kashmir Valley, said essentials such as food, grain and meat would be delivered to different parts of the region by Sunday. There are also fears about access to healthcare. One doctor at a hospital emergency department in Srinagar said patient numbers had drastically reduced. \u201cOn an average day we see over 1,000 patients, but now less than 100 manage to reach here,\u201d the doctor told Agence France-Presse. Ambulance services were not working and people trying to drive to hospital were reportedly turned away at checkpoints. Ali got to a pharmacy to pick up medicine for his child, he said, but supplies were worryingly low. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, said the removal of Kashmir\u2019s special status would bring prosperity and free the state of terrorism, but the decision is widely opposed in Kashmir, where even prominent pro-India politicians have been detained. The move strips Kashmir of the autonomy it was granted in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947. It will lose its constitution and flag. Rules that prevent outsiders from buying land are also being scrapped, prompting fears that the territory\u2019s demography and way of life will be altered. Delhi\u2019s announcement has also escalated tensions with Pakistan and been condemned by China and Iran. According to the semi-official Fars news agency, Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Movahedi Kermani, an adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader told worshippers that India\u2019s actions were \u201can ugly move\u201d. Many in Pakistan are demanding a tough response from the country\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan. Thousands of supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party, marched through Islamabad on Friday to condemn Delhi\u2019s action. In one of the city\u2019s biggest shopping centres, visitors also called for action. \u201cKhan should come up with an effective policy to show the world what India is doing,\u201d said Anam Rana, a student at Quaid-e-Azam university. \u201cWe should talk of peace with India but we can\u2019t clap with one hand,\u201d said Awais Siddiqui, a telecoms engineer. Khan suggested Delhi might carry out ethnic cleansing. He has expelled the Indian high commissioner and halted trade, and Pakistan\u2019s army chief has said his forces would take any action to stand by Kashmiris. \u201cThey can\u2019t be silent because if they are it will be seen as a defeat. For many years they have used Kashmir as a symbol of national unity,\u201d said Khalid Shah, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. Khan has vowed to go to the UN and lobby heads of states, but the response so far has been muted. \u201cUltimately, Pakistan may be frustrated on the world stage, which enhances the likelihood that it may try to resort to sub-conventional uses of force, pushing back at India by encouraging its militant assets,\u201d said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Wilson Center in Washington. \u201cThe next time there is an attack in Kashmir, India will blame Pakistan, regardless of the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the two sides will find themselves in an immediate crisis that could well escalate into a conflict.\u201d Hundreds of migrant workers have fled Kashmir for fear of unrest, and thousands of villagers living along the heavily militarised line of control that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan have also left their homes.",

      "body": "<p>The crisis over Kashmir, triggered by the Indian government\u2019s decision to impose direct rule from Delhi, has universal relevance. It says much about the times we live in and how we are ruled. Here is a semi-autonomous state, part of a federal union protected by a constitution, which has seen its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\" title=\"\">democratic freedoms abruptly abolished</a> by executive decree. This was a very Indian coup, but one with a global context.</p> <p>Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, and the ruling nationalist BJP stand accused of acting without proper legal authority by unilaterally revoking article 370 of the constitution, which guarantees Kashmir\u2019s special status. Delhi\u2019s arbitrary bifurcation of the state into two union territories (Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh) is also legally contentious. Opponents say Modi has <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-kashmir-article-370-scrapped-special-status-amit-shah-narendra-modi-bjp-5880797/\" title=\"\">opted for \u201craw power\u201d over legitimacy</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa4974585b0c79f2f83a57905a9636350cdd8247\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa4974585b0c79f2f83a57905a9636350cdd8247/0_264_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kashmiri people gather in Srinagar to protest against India\u2019s decision to revoke article 370 of the constitution\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kashmiri people gather in Srinagar to protest against India\u2019s decision to revoke article 370 of the constitution</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Modi also ignored UN resolutions on the internationally recognised dispute with Pakistan over sovereign control of the Kashmir region and, notably, the 1972 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simla_Agreement\" title=\"\">Simla agreement</a>, which stipulates that its final status must be settled by peaceful means. That point was <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2019-08-08/statement-attributable-the-spokesman-for-the-secretary-general-the-situation-jammu-and-kashmir\" title=\"\">made last week by the UN secretary-general</a> while appealing for \u201cmaximum restraint\u201d. To cap it all, Modi failed to consult Kashmir\u2019s political leaders, whether pro-independence or pro-India, or the Kashmiri people. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/09/kashmiris-will-erupt-fear-grips-region-as-indian-crackdown-bites\" title=\"\">Quite the opposite, in fact</a>. Political leaders were placed under house arrest. The population was placed under curfew. Means of association and communication were cut. And massive army deployments have been used to enforce Delhi\u2019s diktat.</p> <p>By subverting the constitution, ignoring India\u2019s Simla obligation to ensure that the \u201cprinciples and purposes\u201d of the UN charter govern relations with Pakistan, and removing Kashmiris\u2019 right to self-governance, Modi has placed himself squarely in the wrong. To argue, as he does, that Kashmir is solely an internal matter is to ignore the realities of 70-plus years of strife.</p> <p>So it is particularly striking how insouciant has been the reaction of governments around the world. The US and EU reiterated their Delhi-appeasing view that Kashmir is a bilateral not an international issue. Britain\u2019s response was feeble. Dominic Raab, the neophyte foreign secretary, <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kashmir-article-370-uk-expresses-concern-reiterates-calm-1578460-2019-08-08\" title=\"\">meekly thanked India</a> for a \u201cclear readout of the situation\u201d.</p> <p>Not a word of public criticism of Modi\u2019s high-handed behaviour. Not a thought, apparently, for the dire implications for the UN\u2019s authority, international law and the so-called rules-based global order. Not an iota of understanding that India\u2019s enhanced military occupation may revive a conflict that weaponises religion, race and identity in place of democratic dialogue and inclusion.</p> <p>If this sounds familiar, it should. This is the dog-eats-dog world created by Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>, Vladimir Putin and copycat ultra-nationalist \u201cstrongman\u201d leaders. It is a lawless world where the rules no longer apply, where pacts and treaties are bypassed or torn up, where nations blindly pursue perceived self-interest and where minorities, however defined, are mocked, ignored and exploited.</p> <p>In this harsh, ugly world, Modi the hardline Hindu nationalist and his Muslim-baiting BJP colleagues are a good fit. It may be the case, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/8/9/20798273/kashmir-narendra-modi-india-speech\" title=\"\">as Modi argued</a> last week, that Kashmir has suffered from decades of violence and a lack of jobs and investment. It is certainly true India\u2019s record of <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/06/14/india-act-un-rights-report-kashmir\" title=\"\">human rights abuses in Kashmir</a> is a shaming one.</p> <p>But by imperiously imposing his will, Modi only raises new obstacles to progress. This is not the way forward. It will not improve the lives of most Kashmiris. It will not ease the security burden on the Indian state.

      "bodyText": "The crisis over Kashmir, triggered by the Indian government\u2019s decision to impose direct rule from Delhi, has universal relevance. It says much about the times we live in and how we are ruled. Here is a semi-autonomous state, part of a federal union protected by a constitution, which has seen its democratic freedoms abruptly abolished by executive decree. This was a very Indian coup, but one with a global context. Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, and the ruling nationalist BJP stand accused of acting without proper legal authority by unilaterally revoking article 370 of the constitution, which guarantees Kashmir\u2019s special status. Delhi\u2019s arbitrary bifurcation of the state into two union territories (Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh) is also legally contentious. Opponents say Modi has opted for \u201craw power\u201d over legitimacy. Modi also ignored UN resolutions on the internationally recognised dispute with Pakistan over sovereign control of the Kashmir region and, notably, the 1972 Simla agreement, which stipulates that its final status must be settled by peaceful means. That point was made last week by the UN secretary-general while appealing for \u201cmaximum restraint\u201d. To cap it all, Modi failed to consult Kashmir\u2019s political leaders, whether pro-independence or pro-India, or the Kashmiri people. Quite the opposite, in fact. Political leaders were placed under house arrest. The population was placed under curfew. Means of association and communication were cut. And massive army deployments have been used to enforce Delhi\u2019s diktat. By subverting the constitution, ignoring India\u2019s Simla obligation to ensure that the \u201cprinciples and purposes\u201d of the UN charter govern relations with Pakistan, and removing Kashmiris\u2019 right to self-governance, Modi has placed himself squarely in the wrong. To argue, as he does, that Kashmir is solely an internal matter is to ignore the realities of 70-plus years of strife. So it is particularly striking how insouciant has been the reaction of governments around the world. The US and EU reiterated their Delhi-appeasing view that Kashmir is a bilateral not an international issue. Britain\u2019s response was feeble. Dominic Raab, the neophyte foreign secretary, meekly thanked India for a \u201cclear readout of the situation\u201d. Not a word of public criticism of Modi\u2019s high-handed behaviour. Not a thought, apparently, for the dire implications for the UN\u2019s authority, international law and the so-called rules-based global order. Not an iota of understanding that India\u2019s enhanced military occupation may revive a conflict that weaponises religion, race and identity in place of democratic dialogue and inclusion. If this sounds familiar, it should. This is the dog-eats-dog world created by Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and copycat ultra-nationalist \u201cstrongman\u201d leaders. It is a lawless world where the rules no longer apply, where pacts and treaties are bypassed or torn up, where nations blindly pursue perceived self-interest and where minorities, however defined, are mocked, ignored and exploited. In this harsh, ugly world, Modi the hardline Hindu nationalist and his Muslim-baiting BJP colleagues are a good fit. It may be the case, as Modi argued last week, that Kashmir has suffered from decades of violence and a lack of jobs and investment. It is certainly true India\u2019s record of human rights abuses in Kashmir is a shaming one. But by imperiously imposing his will, Modi only raises new obstacles to progress. This is not the way forward. It will not improve the lives of most Kashmiris. It will not ease the security burden on the Indian state. More likely, it will lead to political resistance across the board, escalating confrontation and the exploitation of tensions by violent extremists on both sides. Modi claims a \u201cnew era\u201d has begun. Kashmiris see only a new calamity. Pakistan\u2019s reaction has been predictably hostile. Imran Khan, elected prime minister one year ago, once spoke of improving relations with Delhi. Such hopes are shattered now. Khan and his generals have sensibly avoided a military response, instead imposing diplomatic and trade sanctions. But this may not satisfy public opinion. Militants based in Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir will want, more than ever, to take the fight to India. Khan has limited options. His country is severely indebted. Modi has been clever in strengthening ties with Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia that traditionally bankrolled Pakistan. None of them spoke up on Islamabad\u2019s behalf last week. Meanwhile, relations with the US have become strained, not least over Afghanistan. No surprise, then, that Pakistan has increasingly looked to China for support. Beijing was one of the few countries to condemn Modi\u2019s coup. It has a geo-strategic interest in curbing India\u2019s influence. It also has a territorial stake in Kashmir. But China\u2019s abuses in Xinjiang, another Muslim majority entity, and its overall attitude to democracy, self-determination and human rights make it a problematic partner. As India steamrollers into a deepening quagmire in Kashmir, Britain and other western countries must work to keep Islamabad on side and at peace. A bullish Modi cannot to be relied on to eschew further provocations. The weaker and more isolated Pakistan becomes, the greater the risk it could hit out.",
