As a student in the mid-1950s I absorbed socialist ideas but rejected joining the Communist party and was held back from joining the Labour party by the antagonism between the Gaitskellites and the Bevanites. However, I eventually joined at the time of the Suez crisis and remember how enthusiastic I was when reading the housing policy document. If that had been adhered to in the periods of Labour government, all housing today would have been either publicly or owner-occupier owned and changes in the use of land would not be making millionaires of its owners, nor pricing new housing beyond the incomes of young people.</p> <p>What happened instead was Anthony Crosland\u2019s book, The Future of Socialism, arguing that the capitalist system had been contained and a balance achieved between public and private enterprise: there was no longer any need to regulate and limit the activities of the market. I thought this naive at the time: John Stuart Mill said the price of liberty was eternal vigilance and I thought this applied equally to the containment of capitalism. However, casting doubt on this view was seen as doctrinaire Marxism, and equated with lack of concern about individual freedom even after 1989.</p> <p>Another issue that cast me into a minority after I joined was my belief in negotiation in place of war and the abolition of nuclear arms. I was distressed about Bevan\u2019s volte-face in 1957. I was by then devoting all my spare time to the Labour party, and had become a constituency officer and a council candidate (I lost in the 1959 elections by a tiny majority). But after Gaitskell\u2019s declaration that he would fight and fight again against nuclear disarmament, I resigned.</p> <p>I joined again in the early 1990s, but after Blair succeeded John Smith I again felt that my principles and concerns were not being given serious consideration. Nevertheless I gave much time and support to the local party until the Iraq war, when I resigned.

      "bodyText": "Andy Beckett\u2019s article on how leftwing views have been systematically marginalised, even demonised, in the Labour party accords with my own experience (We exclude the Labour left from British politics at our peril, 11 March). As a student in the mid-1950s I absorbed socialist ideas but rejected joining the Communist party and was held back from joining the Labour party by the antagonism between the Gaitskellites and the Bevanites. However, I eventually joined at the time of the Suez crisis and remember how enthusiastic I was when reading the housing policy document. If that had been adhered to in the periods of Labour government, all housing today would have been either publicly or owner-occupier owned and changes in the use of land would not be making millionaires of its owners, nor pricing new housing beyond the incomes of young people. What happened instead was Anthony Crosland\u2019s book, The Future of Socialism, arguing that the capitalist system had been contained and a balance achieved between public and private enterprise: there was no longer any need to regulate and limit the activities of the market. I thought this naive at the time: John Stuart Mill said the price of liberty was eternal vigilance and I thought this applied equally to the containment of capitalism. However, casting doubt on this view was seen as doctrinaire Marxism, and equated with lack of concern about individual freedom even after 1989. Another issue that cast me into a minority after I joined was my belief in negotiation in place of war and the abolition of nuclear arms. I was distressed about Bevan\u2019s volte-face in 1957. I was by then devoting all my spare time to the Labour party, and had become a constituency officer and a council candidate (I lost in the 1959 elections by a tiny majority). But after Gaitskell\u2019s declaration that he would fight and fight again against nuclear disarmament, I resigned. I joined again in the early 1990s, but after Blair succeeded John Smith I again felt that my principles and concerns were not being given serious consideration. Nevertheless I gave much time and support to the local party until the Iraq war, when I resigned. I have since rejoined, although I remain critical of the lack of resistance to neoliberal market-economy policies. Many of my views accord with those espoused over the years by Jeremy Corbyn, but I have never been associated with the so-called Trotskyites, nor with undemocratic behaviour. There must be many other members like me \u2013 young and old \u2013 and it is time that we were listened to. Margaret Morris London \u2022 Andy Beckett is right to conclude that it is perilous to exclude the British left from politics. Its ideas have had a positive impact upon the country, particularly through the postwar settlement of 1945, much of which still endures today. The last Labour election manifesto in 2017 was largely pragmatic left in content, and mainstream social democratic by European standards, showing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s astuteness in formulating policy that secured 41% support from the electorate. However, his handling of the parliamentary Labour party leaves a lot be desired because of his lack of inclusivity and bears comparison with previous leaders. Tony Blair, for instance, appointed members of the far-left Campaign group of Labour MPs, of which Corbyn was a member, to frontbench and ministerial positions, including Michael Meacher, Gavin Strang and Tony Banks, despite the group being small in number, with about 30 MPs out of a total PLP of 418 in 1997. The current group has 21 MPs, 10% of the PLP, of which Corbyn has appointed Diane Abbott, Rebecca Long-Bailey and John McDonnell to senior frontbench postions. Yet he has failed to reach out to nearly half of the PLP who do not share his far-left politics, leaving Ed Miliband and Yvette Cooper among others out in the cold despite their relative youth and substantial political and ministerial experience. Despite his popular support within the party as a whole , the recent breakaway of Labour MPs to form the Independent Group suggests that Jeremy Corbyn ignores the mainstream left and centre within the PLP at his peril and needs to broaden the appeal of the party to the wider electorate.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Estimates put the possible death toll of a future full-scale war between India and Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.psr.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/two-billion-at-risk.pdf\">as high as two billion lives</a>.
