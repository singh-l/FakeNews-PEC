      "bodyText": "In a nutshell Both leaders went regional on Tuesday, with Bill Shorten campaigning in Geelong in Victoria and Scott Morrison heading to Albury before crossing the river to Wodonga. An egg stole the limelight when a protester tried to crack one on the prime ministerial noggin, but the attempt failed and the young woman was charged with assault. The incident overshadowed a \u201csconversation\u201d at a meeting of the Country Women\u2019s Association in Albury, where Morrison was announcing the government\u2019s plans for mobile blackspot eradication and funding for regional study hubs. But most importantly, he was trying to rally support from the CWA. \u201cThe CWA is our largest women\u2019s organisation in the country today; 8,000 members here in New South Wales, 370 local branches \u2013 that\u2019s an army,\u201d Morrison told the meeting. Morrison will need all the help he can get if he is going to hang on to the seat of Farrer, which is held by the Liberals\u2019 Sussan Ley. As Guardian Australia\u2019s Gabrielle Chan has reported, there is an uprising in the electorate over the issue of water management which threatens to unseat Ley, despite her healthy 20% margin. Morrison used the failed egging to denounce thuggery, including within the union movement, while Shorten said that anything approaching violence was unacceptable. The Reserve Bank\u2019s interest rate decision played into the election campaign, with Shorten suggesting the prospect of a rate cut showed that the economy was \u201cwallowing in mediocrity\u201d. But the RBA ended up leaving rates on hold, allowing Morrison to dodge that particular bullet. The opposition leader was campaigning in quasi-sandbag territory, visiting Waurn Ponds in the Victorian seat of Corangamite. While the sitting MP is Liberal Sarah Henderson, a redistribution has put the seat on Labor\u2019s side of the ledger and so it is now seen as Shorten\u2019s to lose. Shorten was campaigning on health and also had some strong words on the need for voters to choose Labor over independent candidates, warning of more chaos if minor parties held the balance of power. \u201cLet\u2019s not have three more years of minorities controlling the Senate,\u201d Shorten said. The call comes as Tuesday\u2019s Essential poll showed the primary vote for both major parties stubbornly low, with Labor on 34% and the Coalition on 38%. Elsewhere on the trail In the Northern Territory, the Greens were under fire for their candidate George Hanna sharing a meme that called the Liberals\u2019 indigenous candidate Jacinta Price a \u201ccoconut\u201d \u2013 an insult directed at indigenous people deemed to be \u201cwhite on the inside\u201d. The Nationals\u2019 Matt Canavan described the remarks as evidence of the \u201csewer of social media\u201d seeping into the real world \u2013 sad but true. Price is running for the seat of Lingiari, held by the Labor party\u2019s Warren Snowdon on an 8.2% margin. The big picture I think we can all agree that scones are a winner \u2013 especially those made by the Country Women\u2019s Association. Required reading Katharine Murphy has been pondering a key question: is this election going to mirror the NSW state election, or the Victorian state election?

From the AP:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Whatever role Mueller now has, keeping him on the justice department payroll offers one clear advantage to president Donald Trump\u2019s administration: It makes it easier for attorney general William Barr to block Mueller from testifying before Congress.</p> \n   <p>Democrats, who control the House, have been eager to hear from Mueller. They hope he can shine more light on his investigation into interference in the 2016 presidential election, possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, and potential obstruction of justice.</p> \n   <p>Barr has said repeatedly he doesn\u2019t object to Mueller testifying. But he may defer to the wishes of Trump, who tweeted last weekend: \u201cBob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!\u201d</p> \n   <p>While he\u2019s a DOJ employee, the department would generally handle requests for Mueller to appear before Congress, and the DOJ could delay or block Mueller from voluntarily appearing.

He also said another $325bn in goods would be subject to the 25% tariff.</p> \n  <p>This has upended global stock markets after months of seemingly positive negotiations between the US and China. Trump himself has declared that the discussions were moving in a positive direction, helping to boost global markets anticipating a positive outcome from the talks.</p> \n  <p>China\u2019s market closed down 5.8% on Monday, its worst day since Feb 2016. Europe and US markets also fell, with oil prices \u2013 a benchmark for global trade \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/06/markets-tumble-after-trump-threatens-to-dramatically-increase-china-tariffs\">falling sharply.</a> </p> \n  <p><strong>Liu He, Beijing\u2019s lead trade negotiator, was due in Washington this week </strong>for trade talks that experts predicted would be the last round of discussions before reaching a deal.

The quick version: Companies pay these tariffs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/05/trump-escalates-trade-war-with-china-with-plan-to-raise-tariffs\">when they import goods from China</a>, despite Trump\u2019s claims they are paid by China. US importers then decide to either pass the increased costs on to consumers by raising prices, absorb the cost and take a hit to their profits, try to negotiate costs down or find outside suppliers. </p> \n  <p>Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia, told the Guardian: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactic, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs.

      "bodyText": "Follow Tuesday\u2019s politics news as it happens on our new blog. That\u2019s all for today, thanks for following along! Some links of key events to close out the evening: Hundreds of former federal prosecutors signed a letter saying Trump would have faced \u201cmultiple felony charges of obstruction of justice\u201d if he were not president. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin sent a letter saying he will not release Trump\u2019s tax returns to Congress. The Department of Justice could delay or block Robert Mueller from testifying since he currently is still an employee of the DOJ. Democrats called on Trump\u2019s nominee to be US ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, to clarify that she will prioritize US interests over her own when it comes to climate change. Jerrold Nadler, Democratic chair of the House judiciary committee, proposed to hold attorney general William Barr in contempt after the justice department refused to provide the panel with an unredacted version of Mueller\u2019s report. Trump complained about disaster relief funding in Puerto Rico, amid a standoff with Democrats to approve a disaster aid bill that includes Puerto Rico and other states. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new attack on sanctuary cities, with a program meant to allow local law enforcement to make federal arrests. Trump shocked global financial markets this morning with an unexpected threat to further raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods. Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, began his three-year prison sentence on Monday. Carolyn Meadows, new president of the National Rifle Association, took a potshot at Lucy McBath, the congresswoman who lost her son to gun violence. A dispatch from the Rose Garden ... Donald Trump and Tiger Woods wore matching dark blue suits, white shirts and red ties in the White House Rose Garden as Trump bestowed the presidential medal of freedom, America\u2019s highest civilian honour, on his sometime business and golf partner. The US president, an avid golfer himself, described Woods as \u201cone of the greatest athletes in the history of sports\u201d and a \u201ca global symbol of American excellence, devotion, and drive\u201d during a short ceremony. With evident relish, Trump recounted Woods\u2019 career and the injuries that almost derailed it before his astonishing comeback last month to win a fifth US Masters title. \u201cThe \u2018age of Tiger\u2019 gave us moments that will live forever in sporting lore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next Tiger, it\u2019s going to be good... because there are no winners like you.\u201d The president also praised Woods as a \u201cdevoted philanthropist\u201d, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s how I first met Tiger.\u201d Questions have been raised over Monday\u2019s award because of Trump\u2019s long business relationship with Woods who, at 43, is by far the youngest living sportsperson to receive the medal of freedom. The pair also play golf together, most recently in February. While some African American sports stars have shunned the Trump White House, Woods thanked the president and looked at ease. But he became emotional as he recalled his late father and told his mother, \u201cI love you, mom,\u201d his voice cracking. Thanking those who have supported him over the years, he added: \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the good and bad, the highs and lows, and I would not be in this position without all of your help.\u201d Among guests in the rose garden sunshine were First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and several senators including Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney. They were joined by Woods\u2019 mother Kutilda, 75, daughter Sam Alexis, 11, son Charlie Axel, 10, and girlfriend Erica Herman, 43, as well as his longtime caddie, Joe LaCava. After the ceremony, Woods and his family followed Trump into the Oval Office. Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to Melania Trump and leading contractor for the president\u2019s inaugural committee, is speaking out about her controversial departure and criticizing the White House: In a statement to the New York Times, Winston Wolkoff rejected reports that she was pushed out last year due to lavish spending on the inauguration: Was I fired? No. ... Was I thrown under the bus? Yes.\u201d Lucy McBath, the congresswoman attacked today by the new president of the NRA, responded on Twitter: If you want to understand the significance of more than 370 former federal prosecutors signing a letter saying Trump would be charged with obstruction if he wasn\u2019t president, watch this clip from Neal Katyal, a supreme court attorney and former acting US solicitor general: \u201cIt\u2019s hugely significant, I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it,\u201d he said, noting that the list included \u201creally prominent Republicans\u201d, all agreeing that \u201cthe Mueller report shows the president is a felon\u201d. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has attacked sanctuary cities today with the announcement of a new program meant to allow local law enforcement to make federal arrests to support deportations: Ice said its program would allow a local police officer to serve a warrant and execute an arrest on behalf of immigration authorities. It\u2019s unclear how widely this program may be used and whether it would play a role in cities and states with official sanctuary policies. Sanctuary jurisdictions have fought to reduce this kind of collaboration and prevent local police from aiding Ice and sharing information with federal immigration authorities. Here\u2019s the reaction of Lorella Praeli, deputy political director at the American Civil Liberties Union: This program is just the latest scheme by ICE to enlist local police in its abusive deportation agenda. The agency explicitly aims to subvert the will of local communities that have passed ordinances to prevent exactly this kind of cooperation between police and ICE... ICE and the other agencies complicit in Trump\u2019s deportation force may feel they are above the constitution \u2014 but neither they, nor local police, are exempt from search and seizure laws. With this program, ICE is asking local law enforcement to risk violating the Fourth Amendment. We urge local law enforcement to resist this dangerous proposal and stand by their commitment to the communities they serve. My colleague David Smith is at the White House Rose Garden, where there is a presidential medal of freedom ceremony underway for Tiger Woods : More reactions to the news that the treasury secretary is refusing to hand over Trump\u2019s tax returns... Some have argued that the formal refusal by the treasury department provides further justification for an impeachment inquiry, which could put the Democrats in a better position to access the returns: Others have noted that the stated purpose of the law in question is to allow the Ways and Means committee to have oversight of potential financial conflicts of public officials: Some further background on the origins of the law: Mnuchin, meanwhile, has said he is acting on legal advice from the justice department in reaching his decision. But neither the treasury department nor the justice department have released a formal opinion: Richard Neal, chairman of the house and ways committee, which is seeking Trump\u2019s tax returns, has released a statement on the treasury secretary\u2019s refusal today to hand over the documents: Today, Secretary Mnuchin notified me that the IRS will not provide the documents I requested under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code. I will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response.\u201d Others have suggested a legal battle is now inevitable: Some backstory on the expected legal fight over Trump\u2019s tax returns: Democrats have argued that a 1924 statute requires the treasury secretary to turn over tax returns to the chairs of the congressional tax committees who ask for them for investigative purposes. Trump has also repeatedly claimed that he is under audit by the IRS, which is why he is not releasing his tax returns. The IRS, however, has made clear that audits do not preclude people from releasing their tax returns. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, has further raised questions about whether the president is even under audit. Cohen said during testimony at Capitol Hill that he believed the president was avoiding releasing his tax returns because Trump feared the public scrutiny could lead to tax penalties. As my colleague Jon Swaine notes, the Trump administration has also argued that the Democrats\u2019 premise of investigating the IRS handling of presidents\u2019 tax affairs is false, since the committee is requesting returns for \u201cjust one\u201d president. But past presidents have, of course, released their returns: Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has sent a letter saying he will not release Trump\u2019s tax returns to Congress. The letter says: In reliance on the advice of the Department of Justice, I have determined that the Committee\u2019s request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose, and ... the Department is therefore not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information. Mnuchin\u2019s refusal to release the returns sets the stage for a likely court battle. HuffPost has published an in-depth look at what life is like for Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, the subject of constant attacks by Trump, Fox News and others: The piece follows Omar in her fifth district of Minnesota, where supporters are worried about the steady stream of death threats she has faced. She told HuffPost she was not surprised by Trump\u2019s intense focus on her: This is a president who has come to power because he was very much willing to vilify and demonize immigrants and refugees. He so proudly said we should halt Muslims from entering our country. He clearly has a disdain for black women who see themselves as equal to him. And so, for many people, it\u2019s not a surprise that he finds his biggest nemesis in me. Clearly, I am a nightmare \u2015 because he can\u2019t stop really thinking about ways that he can continue to use my identity to marginalize our communities. Bill Weld, former governor of Massachusetts and the sole Republican to announce a challenge to Trump in the 2020 race, has joined the list of hundreds of former federal prosecutors saying Mueller\u2019s investigation would have resulted in obstruction of justice charges for if Trump weren\u2019t the president. Weld said in a statement: I know that if Donald Trump were sitting in a governor\u2019s mansion or city hall instead of the White House, he would have been indicted for obstruction of justice. There\u2019s not a prosecutor alive who wouldn\u2019t bring charges against someone who tried to prevent witnesses from cooperating with a federal investigation. His announcement comes amid reports that the Massachusetts Republican Party is aiming to protect Trump from primary challengers like Weld, by approving a new winner-takes-all delegate plan, Politico reported: Sam Levin here, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. The AP has a report out revealing that special counsel Robert Mueller remains a justice department employee \u2014 and the department won\u2019t say why. Mueller was expected to step down after concluding his report in March, so it\u2019s unclear why he remains on DOJ payroll. This is noteworthy, because if Mueller is still technically a DOJ employee, then attorney general William Barr could have more sway over Mueller\u2019s potentially testimony before Congress. From the AP: Whatever role Mueller now has, keeping him on the justice department payroll offers one clear advantage to president Donald Trump\u2019s administration: It makes it easier for attorney general William Barr to block Mueller from testifying before Congress. Democrats, who control the House, have been eager to hear from Mueller. They hope he can shine more light on his investigation into interference in the 2016 presidential election, possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, and potential obstruction of justice. Barr has said repeatedly he doesn\u2019t object to Mueller testifying. But he may defer to the wishes of Trump, who tweeted last weekend: \u201cBob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!\u201d While he\u2019s a DOJ employee, the department would generally handle requests for Mueller to appear before Congress, and the DOJ could delay or block Mueller from voluntarily appearing. Congress could issue a subpoena to compel him to appear before the committee. This is Amanda Holpuch in New York, with a quick evening summary before handing over the blog to Sam Levin in Oakland. More than 350 prosecutors signed a statement saying Trump would have been charged with obstruction if he wasn\u2019t president. \u201cBut, to look at these facts and say that a prosecutor could not probably sustain a conviction for obstruction of justice \u2014 the standard set out in Principles of Federal Prosecution \u2014 runs counter to logic and our experience,\u201d the letter said. Donald Trump\u2019s bitter confrontation with his political opponents continued to intensify on Monday, after House Democrats set up a vote to hold his attorney general, William Barr, in contempt of Congress. Democrats are calling on Trump\u2019s nominee to be US ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, to clarify that she will prioritize US interests over her own when it comes to climate change. Trump complained about disaster relief funding in Puerto Rico, amid a standoff with Democrats to approve a disaster aid bill that includes Puerto Rico as well as several US states. A Donald Trump tweet from September 2013 is getting renewed attention amid news that the US is deploying resources to the Middle East in response to what it called \u201ca credible threat\u201d by Iranian regime forces. The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, has more details on the deployment: Rotations of US troops and military hardware around the world are routine and usually take place without fanfare. At present there is no aircraft carrier or bomber taskforce in US Central Command\u2019s area of operations, the Middle East and Afghanistan. The Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group is in the Mediterranean and was on the way to the Middle East anyway, but defence officials said its trip would be accelerated. It was unclear on Monday what kind of bombers would be deployed to the region and where they would be based. The announced deployment comes in the midst of a week of particular high tension. On 2 May, the US ended waivers that allowed China, India and Turkey to continue to buy Iranian oil without US sanctions. Wednesday marks the first anniversary of the US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, and both Donald Trump and Hassan Rouhani are expected to mark the day by raising the stakes. Donald Trump\u2019s tweet this morning that Puerto Rico \u201cshould be happy\u201d with the amount of money its received for disaster funding, which is far short of the $91bn he claims it received, has been criticized today. About 40 minutes after Trump\u2019s complaint about Puerto Rico, 2020 Democratic hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, tweeted: \u201cWe won\u2019t stop fighting until the people of Puerto Rico get the respect they deserve\u201d and a link to legislation she re-introduced last week that would aid the debt-ridden island. Arizona representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, was critical of the president\u2019s statements about Puerto Rico disaster funding, tweeting: \u201cyou might as well say the brown people have misspent while the white people have not.\u201d Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, another 2020 hopeful, said the US response to Puerto Rico was \u201cunconscionable.\u201d \u201cThe people of Puerto Rico have been experiencing a humanitarian crisis for over a year and a half since Hurricane Maria,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt is totally unconscionable that in the wealthiest nation in the world we have allowed our fellow citizens to suffer for so long.\u201d Guardian economic correspondent, Richard Partington, wrote a great Q&amp;A about Trump\u2019s unexpected threat this morning to raise tariffs on Chinese goods. The announcement, which came after months of seemingly positive movement in trade negotiations between the US and China, sent global financial markets tumbling on Monday. Is a peace deal still possible? While Trump\u2019s tweets could suggest trade talks have hit a brick wall, analysts said the threat likely represents a shift in negotiating strategy. The president is well-known for ramping up the rhetoric in trade negotiations, and has previously said he can only secure new trade deals by threatening or imposing tariffs on trading partners. Analysts expect that the tensions could linger as the US gears up for elections next year. The threat could extract additional concessions, although that is highly risky. Contrary to Trump\u2019s claims that tariffs have boosted the US economy, analysts said they had hit growth over recent months and that an escalation could inflict greater damage. Donald Trump\u2019s bitter confrontation with his political opponents continued to intensify on Monday, after House Democrats set up a vote to hold his attorney general, William Barr, in contempt of Congress, writes David Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Washington Bureau Chief. A contempt vote would carry symbolic force but it would not compel Barr to hand over the report. The full House would need to approve it, sending a criminal referral to the US attorney for the District of Columbia \u2013 a justice department official likely to defend the attorney general. Democrats argue they need to see the full report, including underlying materials, in order to conduct a complete review of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Nadler said the committee wants to see witness interviews and \u201citems such as contemporaneous notes\u201d that are cited in the report. He also asked that all members of Congress be allowed to review an unredacted version. As the conflict with Barr has worsened, Democrats have been in negotiations to hear from Mueller himself. Trump complicated those negotiations on Sunday when he tweeted that he would oppose Mueller\u2019s testimony. Trump had previously said he would leave the question to Barr, who has said he has no objection to Mueller testifying. Nadler said last week the committee was \u201cfirming up the date\u201d for Mueller\u2019s testimony, hoping it would be 15 May. Time for an update on 2020 campaign dog, Bailey. Bailey the golden retriever lives with senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachussets, and today he is celebrating spring: Bailey is not just a trusted companion, but also, apparently, a beloved member of the Warren campaign. He\u2019s got his own selfie lines at organizing events and is popular on social media, according to Politico: There\u2019s a rich history surrounding those occupying or aspiring to the White House and their pets. Millie, George HW Bush\u2019s English springer spaniel, authored her own book. After Bill Clinton got a Labrador retriever and named him Buddy, his pollster reported back to the poll-hungry president that a survey showed 57 percent of Americans approved of the name. Donald Trump is the first president in more than a century not to have a pooch join his family at the White House. The topic came up at a rally last month in Texas. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind having one, honestly, but I don\u2019t have any time,\u201d Trump said. He said he\u2019s been told it would be \u201cgood politically,\u201d but it \u201cfeels a little phony, phony to me.\u201d Carolyn Meadows, the new president of the National Rifle Association, who\u2019s from Cobb County, Georgia, has taken a potshot today at Lucy McBath, who won a congressional seat in Georgia in the 2018 midterm elections after running strongly on a platform of gun safety. They can\u2019t be expected to see eye-to-eye on firearms issues, but Meadows goes beyond (or below) all that. In an interview with the Marietta Daily Journal, Meadows said that the reason McBath won was because she is a \u201cminority female\u201d. Meadows, 80, succeeded Oliver North (of Iran-Contra infamy) after he was forced out of the position last month during a power struggle with NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre - amid troubles at the organization. \u201cI would not have taken this job if I didn\u2019t feel like I could save this country. That\u2019s obvious, I\u2019m not young. \u2026 My husband said, \u2018Your whole life has led you to this point.\u2019 And he said, \u2018If you don\u2019t do it, you dishonor God,\u2019\u201d Meadows said, adding that she defines herself as \u201cnot a religious person \u2014 I\u2019m a Christian.\u201d McBath unseated Republican incumbent Karen Handel and Handel has announced she will try for the seat again. \u201cWe\u2019ll get that seat back\u201d, Meadows told the MDJ. She then adds: \u201cBut it is wrong to say, like McBath said, that the reason she won was because of her anti-gun stance. That didn\u2019t have anything to do with it \u2014 it had to do with being a minority female.\u201d She also blamed insufficient conservative turn-out. Democrats are calling on Trump\u2019s nominee to be US ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, to clarify that she will prioritize US interests over her own when it comes to climate change. Craft has invested more than $60m in oil companies and other fossil fuel entities and is married to the CEO of one of the largest US coal producers, Alliance Resource Partners. Senators Ed Markey, of Massachusetts; Jeff Merkley, of Oregon; and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island, asked her to demonstrate she will avoid any conflicts of interest. This push was announced the same day the United Nations painted a terrifying portrait of the earth\u2019s health: From coral reefs flickering out beneath the oceans to rainforests desiccating into savannahs, nature is being destroyed at a rate tens to hundreds of times higher than the average over the past 10m years, according to the UN global assessment report. The biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82%, natural ecosystems have lost about half their area and a million species are at risk of extinction \u2013 all largely as a result of human actions, said the study, compiled over three years by more than 450 scientists and diplomats. Donald Trump hosted the football team from West Point military academy at the White House today for a trophy ceremony to celebrate their 11-2 winning season. At the ceremony, Trump said he is considering offering a waiver that allows athletes at the country\u2019s military academy\u2019s to play professional supports after graduation, instead of fulfilling a two-year active duty military service requirement before going pro. Instead, Trump said, athletes would \u201cserve their time after they\u2019re finished with professional sports.\u201d If you thought this was an unusually mundane comment by the president, you\u2019d be wrong. Such waivers existed in the past \u2013 until Trump\u2019s Department of Defense rescinded them in 2017. And the Pentagon told the AP on Monday that they did not know about any impending changes to that policy. There\u2019s a hefty report out today in the New York Times about what female Democrats are up against in the 2020 election, according to those female Democrats: In an interview in Iowa, Ms Gillibrand specifically alluded to Mr Buttigieg and Mr O\u2019Rourke, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think either of them have won red and purple areas. I have.\u201d She also added a warning for the Democrats trying to occupy a more moderate lane, as Mr Biden has since entering the race. \u201cIf your ideas aren\u2019t progressive or bold enough, you will not win the respect of the grass-roots,\u201d Ms Gillibrand said. \u201cYou will not win young people. You will not win black women \u2014 all the people who were responsible for electing a Democratic majority this last election cycle in the House of Representatives.\u201d The story also notes that 2020 hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar have never lost an election in their political careers. The most prominent male candidates all have (Biden, Buttigieg, O\u2019Rourke, Sanders and Booker). The US has never had a female president. The prosecutors, who have worked for administrations hailing from both sides of the political aisle, contradicts the conclusion made by attorney general William Barr after Mueller did not come to a decision on whether the president should be indicted, that there was not a criminal case for obstruction. Mueller had specifically said that Trump was not exonerated. The prosecutors say in their statement: \u201cEach of us believes that the conduct of President Trump described Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Report would, in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President, result in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice,\u201d the former federal prosecutors wrote. \u201cWe emphasize that these are not matters of close professional judgment,\u201d they added. \u201cOf course, there are potential defenses or arguments that could be raised in response to an indictment of the nature we describe here . . . But, to look at these facts and say that a prosecutor could not probably sustain a conviction for obstruction of justice \u2014 the standard set out in Principles of Federal Prosecution \u2014 runs counter to logic and our experience.\u201d More than 370 former federal prosecutors have signed a statement saying they believe special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation would have resulted in obstruction of justice charges for Donald Trump if he wasn\u2019t the president of the United States. The statement has been issued on publishing platform Medium this afternoon. More details in the coming moments. Republican Rick Scott, Florida\u2019s ex-governor and now US Senator, really doesn\u2019t like 2020 Dem candidate Cory Booker\u2019s progressive gun violence prevention plan, unveiled this morning. Scott tweeted the, to him, outrageous notion that \u201cif you want to buy a gun, @CoryBooker wants you to register with the federal government\u201d, adding: \u201cThis would be scary if Booker had any chance of becoming president.\u201d He called it the latest terrible idea from Dems in the 2020 race. He then went on, or possibly off the rails, in the second of a two-post tweet shower, thus: \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Will we have to register sharp knives? Maybe @AOC will make us register every time we buy meat as part of her #GreenNewDeal.\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez promptly countered with her trademark blast of straight-talking fresh air. The freshman Democratic representative from New York, aka @AOC, tweeted: \u201cThat a sitting US Senator can say something lacking so much critical thinking + honesty is embarrassing to the institution. If you were a female candidate, maybe you\u2019d be called \u201cunlikeable,\u201d \u201ccrazy,\u201d or \u201cuninformed.\u201d But since you\u2019re not, this inadequacy is accepted as normal.\u201d Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, just arrived at prison in New York to begin serving his three-year prison sentence today in New York. Cohen is the third Trump campaign aide to go to prison in the past 12 months. Outside his New York City apartment this morning, Cohen promised: \u201cThere still remains much to be told and I look forward to the day the day I can tell the truth.\u201d In a series of Tweets last night, Trump attempted to control the aftermath of the Muller report, which has seen Congressional committees calling up Trump associates for testimonies and requests for additional, unredacted documents. The House Judiciary committee announced it would vote Wednesday on whether to find attorney general William Barr in contempt of Congress. Trump unexpectedly announced he would further raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods, sending global financial markets tumbling. Trump complained about disaster relief funding in Puerto Rico, amid a standoff with Democrats to approve a disaster aid bill that includes Puerto Rico as well as several US states. US senator Cory Booker, a 2020 Democratic hopeful, unveiled an ambitious gun violence prevention plan. Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, has arrived at an upstate New York prison around 11:30 am on Monday. Here\u2019s what he can expect, writes the Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy: The prison, which houses about 800 inmates, has been rated among the country\u2019s cushiest, thanks to its facilities for non-violent offenders which include bunkhouse-style sleeping and personal lockers. It is also especially set up for Jewish inmates, such as Cohen will be, with availability of such specialty foods as matzoh ball soup, gefilte fish and rugelach pastries, as well as access to a full-time rabbi. Prison consultants say Otisville has become a requested destination for Jewish inmates due to its proximity to New York City\u2019s large Jewish population and upstate New York\u2019s Orthodox Jewish enclaves. But it\u2019s still prison, former Otisville case manager Jack Donson said. \u201cPrison is disrespectful. It\u2019s impersonal,\u201d Donson said. \u201cHe\u2019s never going to get any sleep because there\u2019s always lights on, there\u2019s always inmates snoring. There are officers walking around jingling keys. You shower out in the open. It\u2019s very demeaning.\u201d A majority of Americans support getting rid of the Electoral College and having elections determined exclusively by the popular vote, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Of those polled, 53% said the presidential election should use a popular vote, while 43% should continue to use the electoral college. The findings fall pretty closely in line with whether people backed Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Clinton won the popular vote by 2.9 million votes, while Trump won 306 electoral votes to Clinton\u2019s 232 electoral votes Of the people surveyed who voted for Trump in 2016, 74% wanted to keep using the electoral college, while 78% of Clinton voters want to use the popular vote. The Electoral College allocates electoral votes to each state based on how many representatives and senators it has. Because each state has two senators, electoral votes tilt toward giving smaller states more power in the election. For instance, California has one electoral vote per 712,000 people and Wyoming has one for 195,000 people, according to NBC News. The top Republican on the House Judiciary committee, representative Doug Collins, of Georgia, was critical of Wednesday\u2019s planned vote on contempt for Attorney General William Barr. \u201cDemocrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,\u201d Collins said. Collins said the upcoming vote is \u201cillogical and disingenuous\u201d as negotiations are underway with the Justice Department for access, according to the AP. Donald Trump is complaining about disaster funding to Puerto Rico, again. On Twitter, Trump said Puerto Rico has already received more money from Congress than any state in the history of the US and complained Democrats won\u2019t back a bill that gives disaster relief money to states including Georgia, North Carolina and Alabama. \u201cPuerto Rico should be very happy and the Dems should stop blocking much needed Disaster Relief!\u201d Trump tweeted. The president is in a standoff with Democrats, who want a disaster aid funding bill to include money for Puerto Rico, as well as the others states. In the tweets, Trump said Puerto Rico had received $91bn in disaster relief funding - which is not true. There has been $41bn in announced funding. The additional $50bn is money that one internal estimate said could need to be committed in the long-term. This weekend, Boston Red Sox manager, Alex Cora, said he wouldn\u2019t visit the White House to celebrate the team\u2019s 2018 World Series win because of the Trump administration\u2019s response to the hurricane. Cora is Puerto Rican. Several other Red Sox players have also said they would be skipping the ceremony. Since Hurricane Maria devastated the entire island of Puerto Rico in September 2017, Trump has routinely minimized, dismissed or ignored the scale of destruction\u2013 including denying the official death toll. The US House judiciary committee took its first step to hold the attorney general, William Barr, in contempt of Congress this morning, after Barr failed to provide a copy of the unredacted Mueller report before the committee\u2019s deadline. On Wednesday, the committee will debate a resolution and a 27-page report on Barr being held in contempt, then hold a vote on the resolution. If the vote goes through, it will move to a full vote in the House to authorize legal proceedings. House Judiciary committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler, said in a statement: Even in redacted form, the Special Counsel\u2019s report offers disturbing evidence and analysis that President Trump engaged in obstruction of justice at the highest levels. Congress must see the full report and underlying evidence to determine how to best move forward with oversight, legislation, and other constitutional responsibilities. Donald Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, just navigated through a swarm of photographers and television cameras outside his apartment in New York City, before hopping into a black SUV to take him to prison, about 70 miles north of the city. Cohen made a brief statement to reporters: I hope that when I rejoin my family and friends that the country will be in a place without xenophobia, injustice and lies at the helm of our country. There still remains much to be told and I look forward to the day the day I can tell the truth. Cohen was sentenced last December to three years in prison for tax evasion, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations. He is the third former Trump aide to go to prison in the past 12 months. 2020 update: New Jersey senator Cory Booker, a Democrat, this morning unveiled his plan to tackle gun violence \u2013 which in 2017 saw gun deaths in the US rise to its highest rate in more than 20 years. Booker\u2019s campaign outlined the ambitious plan on Medium. It included several measures which Booker said would be a focus on day one of his presidency: Universal background checks. Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. More funding for gun violence research. Requiring gun owners to obtain a license to purchase and own a firearm. A national database to register and track guns. Repealing a law that protects the gun industry from nearly all lawsuits. Require \u201cmicrostamping,\u201d which helps trace shell casings to a specific weapon. Expand the law so people found guilty of non-felony abuse for violence against a partner of former partner are prohibited from purchasing a firearm - known as the \u201cboyfriend loophole.\u201d Donald Trump shocked global financial markets this morning with an unexpected threat to further raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods. In September, Trump imposed a 10% tariff on $200bn in goods from China, including food, chemicals and electronics. On Twitter last night, Trump said he planned to hike that tariff to 25%. He also said another $325bn in goods would be subject to the 25% tariff. This has upended global stock markets after months of seemingly positive negotiations between the US and China. Trump himself has declared that the discussions were moving in a positive direction, helping to boost global markets anticipating a positive outcome from the talks. China\u2019s market closed down 5.8% on Monday, its worst day since Feb 2016. Europe and US markets also fell, with oil prices \u2013 a benchmark for global trade \u2013 falling sharply. Liu He, Beijing\u2019s lead trade negotiator, was due in Washington this week for trade talks that experts predicted would be the last round of discussions before reaching a deal. China has not announced how Trump\u2019s announcement will impact Liu\u2019s travel plans. And if you\u2019re wondering, who pays for these tariffs? A long explanation is here. The quick version: Companies pay these tariffs when they import goods from China, despite Trump\u2019s claims they are paid by China. US importers then decide to either pass the increased costs on to consumers by raising prices, absorb the cost and take a hit to their profits, try to negotiate costs down or find outside suppliers. Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia, told the Guardian: There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactic, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs. If it\u2019s the latter we\u2019ll see massive downside pressure across all markets. Happy Monday and welcome to today\u2019s politics live blog. The Mueller report saga is far from over. Donald Trump has reversed his earlier position on whether special counsel Robert Mueller should be allowed to testify before a Congressional committee about his 448-page report into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Last night, Trump tweeted \u201cBob Mueller should not testify,\u201d backing away from an earlier claim that he would support William Barr\u2019s decision on whether Mueller should testify. The attorney general has said it would be fine if he did. Barr is also due to respond to Representative Jerry Nadler, the House judiciary committee chairman, who gave the attorney general a Monday deadline to provide an unredacted version of the Mueller report. Trump has repeatedly mischaracterized the report\u2019s findings. Mueller did not assess collusion because it is not a legal term and instead focused on potential criminal conspiracy between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia. Mueller said there was not sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges for obstruction, but wrote the president couldn\u2019t be exonerated from such allegations, either. Elsewhere: The president\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is set to begin serving his three-year prison sentence today in New York. Cohen is the third Trump campaign aide to go to prison in the past 12 months. Trump unexpectedly announced he would further raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods, sending global financial markets tumbling. And the US is sending an aircraft carrier and a bomber task force to the Middle East in response to \u201cescaltory indications\u201d from Iran, according to National Security Adviser, John Bolton, who did not identify what caused the US to escalate tensions in the region. We\u2019ll have more on all this throughout the morning, as well as rolling updates through the day.",
