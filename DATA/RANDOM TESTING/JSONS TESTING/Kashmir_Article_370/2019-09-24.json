A new poll released this weekend found <strong>Elizabeth Warren </strong>edging out Biden in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa. According to the CNN/Des Moines Register <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/21/politics/iowa-poll-2020-democrats/index.html\">poll</a>, the Massachusetts senator is attracting the support of 22 percent of Iowa Democrats, compared to the former vice president\u2019s 20 percent. </p> \n  <p>But what\u2019s arguably even more surprising about the results is how much every other candidate, including <strong>Bernie Sanders, </strong>has fallen behind the two front-runners.

      "bodyText": "That is it from me for the night. Here are the top stories to note from this afternoon: Ilhan Omar said she does not back Joe Biden for 2020 elections. Three House chairmen are threatening to subpoena Trump on the Ukraine controversy. Manhattan\u2019s district attorney urged a judge on Monday to reject Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to block prosecutors from obtaining his tax returns. Trump tells reporters he would win the Nobel Peace prize \u2018if they gave it out fairly\u2019 Trump administration asks city officials in Iowa to remove LGBTQ-inclusive art from public spaces. Happy Monday and good night! Officials in Ames, Iowa say the Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has requested the city remove inclusive multi-colored crosswalk art in a letter sent this month. Ames, a college town with a population of around 67,000 people, installed painted sidewalks earlier this month. The new art includes gender non-binary pride colors, rainbow colors for LGBTQ rights, and colors representing support of transgender equality. It is reportedly unusual for a federal agency to make such a call and Ames officials believe the FHWA does not have jurisdiction over the roads in question. \u201cThe FHWA did not have a direct answer to this question, and it appears they are still researching whether they have any regulatory authority in this situation,\u201d officials in Ames said, according to local news station KCCI. \u201cThese streets are not part of a federal highway and these streets receive no federal funding. With the system of federalism in the United States, the federal government does not have jurisdiction over everything.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden implied he will not attempt to convince Iowans to vote for him in the state\u2019s 2020 Caucus. Biden is currently in second place, according to the latest polls of Iowa voters, at 20%. Elizabeth Warren is leading the polls in Iowa, with 22% of voters saying she is most likely to receive their vote. In an erratic exchange with reporters from Pakistan on Monday, Donald Trump said he would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \u201cif they gave it out fairly.\u201d He spoke with the press outside the United Nations General Assembly ahead of a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. Members of the Pakistani press praised him , saying he would \u201cdefinitely\u201d be deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize if he could solve tensions in the Kashmir region. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things, if they gave it out fairly, which they don\u2019t,\u201d Trump said. He went on to complain about former president Barack Obama receiving the prize in 200. The committee awarded Obama the prize for his \u201cefforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\u201d \u201cThey gave one to Obama immediately upon his ascent to the presidency, and he had no idea why he got it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you know what? That was the only thing I agreed with him on.\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reportedly nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize at the request of the U.S. government in February 2019. Manhattan\u2019s district attorney urged a judge on Monday to reject Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to block prosecutors from obtaining his tax returns, saying the president wants \u201csweeping immunity.\u201d From the Associated Press: District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. filed papers in federal court after Trump\u2019s attorneys sued last week to stop Vance from forcing the president\u2019s accounting firm to release eight years of his state and federal returns in a criminal probe. Vance urged a judge to reject Trump\u2019s request for a temporary order blocking Vance\u2019s subpoena for the records in a probe of payments made to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. He also asked U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero to dismiss the lawsuit. Vance said Trump was asserting the \u201cremarkable proposition\u201d that a sitting president not only enjoys blanket immunity from criminal prosecution, but also isn\u2019t required to submit to any routine grand jury request for information about what he, his businesses or employees did before he took office. \u201cThe law provides no such sweeping immunity,\u201d the court papers said. \u201cHere, the question is not whether a state prosecutor can indict a sitting President,\u201d the papers said. \u201cInstead, the issue is whether a third party, having been duly served with a state grand jury subpoena seeking the books and records of a number of individuals and corporate entities, including those of the President, must comply with the subpoena.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers have called the subpoena requests by Vance, a Democrat, a \u201cbad faith effort to harass\u201d Trump. Trump\u2019s lawyers say records shouldn\u2019t be released until Trump leaves office. Three House chairmen have threatened to subpoena the Trump administration for documents related to Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to dig up damaging information on rival Joe Biden. Trump admitted Sunday he had spoken to the president of Ukraine in an attempt to reopen an investigation of a business with links to the former vice-president\u2019s son. Democratic lawmakers have said this use of the presidential office to investigate a political adversary is grounds for impeachment. A joint statement penned by Eliot L Engel, the House foreign affairs committee chairman, Adam B Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, and Elijah E Cummings, the House oversight committee chairman, took the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to task for withholding documents on the matter and gave him until Thursday to respond to the inquiry. \u201cSeeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy and the constitution, which the president is sworn to preserve, protect and defend,\u201d the chairmen wrote in the letter. \u201cYet the president and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.\u201d The committees asked for the documents two weeks ago. Since then, it has emerged that Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire is holding back a whistleblower complaint from Congress. The AP and other news outlets have reported the complaint is linked to a phone call where Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son. Ilhan Omar said in an interview at the Iowa People\u2019s Presidential Forum that Joe Biden is not the right candidate for \u201cprogress we all want to see\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s been very clear to many of the people creating the kind of movement that is exciting generations that we want somebody who really has a plan that is going to tackle a lot of the systematic challenges that we have,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Omar, a House representative from Minnesota, has made waves as a member of a progressive group of new Congress members alongside representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. She did not indicate if she backed any of the other candidates running for office in 2020. Hello readers, this is Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over the blog for the next few hours. More news to come. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump pushed back against reports that he allegedly pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, arguing that \u201ccrooked\u201d journalists should be more concerned about the former vice-president\u2019s actions. (But there has been no evidence to substantiate Trump\u2019s corruption claims against Biden.) Meanwhile, one of Trump\u2019s advisers reportedly acknowledged that the Ukraine controversy could become a \u201cserious problem\u201d. Mitch McConnell accused Democratic lawmakers of trying to \u201cpoliticize\u201d the whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president after Chuck Schumer demanded oversight hearings on the matter. The Democratic National Committee announced its heightened requirements to qualify for the fifth presidential debate. Candidates must attract at least 165,000 unique donors and receive at least 3% of support in four polls (or 5% of support in two early-state polls). Young climate activist Greta Thunberg addressed the UN general assembly and denounced leaders\u2019 inaction on combating climate change. \u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u201d Thunberg said. Kari will have more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Amy Klobuchar, is tweeting about the DNC\u2019s heightened requirements to qualify for the fifth debate, urging her supporters to donate. But according to an MSNBC reporter, the Minnesota senator has already crossed the fundraising threshold of attracting at least 165,000 unique donors. Climate protests halt traffic in Washington There were more than two dozen arrests in the nation\u2019s capital over this morning\u2019s \u201cShut Down DC\u201d climate crisis protests. Strategically staged as a direct action, demonstrators blocked major commuter arteries in Washington, DC. At least 26 people had been arrested before 9.30AM, according to the capital\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. The protests were organized under the umbrella of at least 20 organizations, including 350.org, Black Lives Matter, Extinction Rebellion and Friends of the Earth, with the hashtag #ShutDownDC, demanding \u201csweeping action\u201d on the climate crisis. Crowds blocked traffic, causing gridlock, as they demanded action from world leaders. They were part of the global climate strike led by youth activists that brought many millions of people out to protest last Friday in the largest climate protest in history. Monday\u2019s protest was followed by an angry and emotional speech at the UN climate summit in New York by youth activist Greta Thunberg. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister facing severe political troubles back home, expressed confidence that Trump would be able to strike a new deal with Iran after throwing out the 2015 nuclear agreement. \u201cLet\u2019s do a better deal,\u201d Johnson told NBC News. \u201cI think there\u2019s one guy who can do a better deal ... and that is the president of the United States. I hope there will be a Trump deal.\u201d Johnson added that Britain was \u201cvirtually certain\u201d Iran was behind the attack earlier this month on a Saudi oil facility and that he considered Trump to be a \u201cvery, very brilliant negotiator\u201d. Trump resurfaced his \u201cFredo\u201d insult against Chris Cuomo when discussing the CNN host\u2019s recent interview with the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. \u201cI watched Rudy take apart Fredo,\u201d Trump said of the interview. \u201cRudy Giuliani took Fredo to the cleaners. First time I\u2019ve watched CNN in a long time.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s interview with Cuomo went viral after the president\u2019s lawyer contradicted himself about whether he had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and accused the CNN host of being \u201cthe enemy\u201d. The campaign manager for Tom Steyer announced that the billionaire activist has similarly already met the donor threshold for the fifth Democratic debate, which was announced this afternoon. The campaign manager for Cory Booker, who qualified for the third and fourth debates but issued a fundraising plea to supporters this weekend, acknowledged that the New Jersey senator has not yet met either threshold. In a Senate floor speech, Mitch McConnell accused senior Democratic lawmakers, including Chuck Schumer, of trying to \u201cpoliticize\u201d allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate one of his political opponents. Schumer wrote a letter to McConnell earlier today urging the Senate majority leader to hold hearings on whether Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to incentivize launching a probe into Biden. Schumer wrote: \u201cThe Republican-led Senate has remained silent and submissive, shying away from this institution\u2019s constitutional obligation to conduct oversight.\u201d While speaking to (and disparaging) reporters at the UN General Assembly, Trump also denied that he pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden. But he very questionably argued that such a move, pressuring a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent, would be acceptable. \u201cI think it might probably, possibly have been okay if I did, but I didn\u2019t,\u201d Trump said, much to the likely chagrin of every ethics expert in the country. The campaign manager for Cory Booker, who issued a fundraising plea to his supporters over the weekend, acknowledged that the New Jersey senator has not met either of the qualification thresholds for the November debate. The Democratic National Committee has just announced that each debate participant must attract at least 165,000 unique donors and at least 3 percent in four polls (or at least 5 percent in two early-state polls). But one of Booker\u2019s competitors, tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, voiced confidence that he would qualify for the November debate. An adviser to Trump acknowledged to CNN that his call with the Ukrainian president about Joe Biden could become a major issue for the administration. \u201cThis is a serious problem for us,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cHe admitted doing it.\u201d CNN has more: A separate source close to the White House said Trump\u2019s team is treating the Ukraine story like the President\u2019s taxes: That is, a problem but one that can potentially be fought out in the media and in the courts, if needed. The source familiar with the matter said some on Trump\u2019s internal White House legal team are currently leaning against releasing the transcript from the call. But a White House official brushed off concerns about Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president, calling it \u2018Mueller 2.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u2019 the official said. Trump repeated his debunked corruption claims against Joe Biden and accused the media of being \u201ccrooked as hell\u201d for not reporting the false accusations as fact. \u201cJoe Biden and his son are corrupt ... but the fake news doesn\u2019t want to report it because they\u2019re Democrats,\u201d Trump said at the UN General Assembly. The president added, \u201cIf a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they\u2019d be getting the electric chair probably right now.\u201d Again, there has been no evidence of Biden trying to profit off his office while serving as vice president. Trump went on to slam the media. \u201cYou people ought to be ashamed of yourselves,\u201d he told the assembled journalists. While noting that he appreciated the work of some reporters, he argued that most were \u201ccrooked as hell.\u201d The Democratic National Committee has once again ratcheted up the qualifications for the next Democratic debate, which will take in November. The DNC announced in a statement that presidential candidates would have two means of meeting the polling qualification and would also have to attract 165,000 unique donors to make the debate stage. On the polling front, candidates would either have to receive at least 3 percent of support in four polls or at least 5 percent in two single-state polls from the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada. The raised qualifications threaten to once again decrease the number of debate-eligible candidates. After the DNC hiked the minimum figures for the third and fourth debates, the number of participants was essentially cut in half. This could spell trouble for lower-polling candidates like Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Juli\u00e1n Castro who managed to qualify for the last debates -- let alone candidates like Steve Bullock and John Delaney who failed to make the cut last time. Trump\u2019s dubious claims about Joe Biden trying to profit off his vice presidency are now being supported by the Republican National Committee in an email to supporters. But Trump\u2019s claims are completely baseless, as the Washington Post reports: Trump has claimed that Biden in 2016 pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the top Ukrainian prosecutor, because he was investigating a Ukrainian gas producer, Burisma Holdings, that had added Biden\u2019s son Hunter to its board. But it turns out that the investigation had already been shelved when Biden acted and may have even involved a side company, not Burisma. The Ukrainian prosecutor was regarded as a failure, and \u2018Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to oust Shokin were universally praised,\u2019 said Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist heavily involved in Eastern European market reforms. Moreover, Yuri Lutsenko, a former Ukrainian prosecutor general who succeeded the fired prosecutor, told Bloomberg News that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Pete Buttigieg, appeared more cautious when asked about lawmakers gaining access to a transcript of the phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president. He noted the concerns about potentially classified information but emphasized that Democrats should investigate the matter. Buttigieg has returned to Iowa to campaign in the first-in-the-nation caucus state as a new poll shows him nearly even with Bernie Sanders in his support. While speaking to reporters at the UN General Assembly, Trump once again proved that flattery will get you everywhere with the US president. American reporters complained on Twitter that Trump stopped taking questions from them during his meeting with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, after a Pakistani reporter lavished praise on the president. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris had harsh words for Trump amid his Ukraine controversy, saying the incident demonstrates why the president should be impeached. Trump has already repeatedly faced questions at the UN General Assembly today about what he and Volodymyr Zelenskiy discussed regarding Joe Biden in their July phone call. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump has confirmed he discussed Joe Biden with the Ukrainian president as calls for his impeachment escalate among House Democrats. The president will likely face more questions on the controversy today as he attends the UN General Assembly. The young climate activist Greta Thunberg addressed the UN, denouncing leaders for their inaction on combating climate change. A new Iowa poll shows Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are neck-and-neck in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, as Bernie Sanders has slipped into a decided third place. The blog is still covering the latest updates on the Ukraine controversy and the campaign trail, so stay tuned. Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker has raised more than 500,000 since his campaign sent out a desperate weekend email asking supporters to offer financial support to his bid. \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: Cory 2020 needs to raise an additional $1.7 million by September 30 to be in a position to build the organization necessary to continue competing for the nomination,\u201d his campaign manger, Addisu Demissie, wrote in an email to supporters on Saturday. \u201cWithout a fundraising surge to close out this quarter, we do not see a legitimate long-term path forward.\u201d The campaign announced this morning that it is almost a third of the way toward its goal, having raised $508,629 since it sent out the request. \u201cWe\u2019re lifted by the influx of support for Cory\u2019s campaign for president -- even from individuals who haven\u2019t made up their minds who to support in this race but who believe Cory\u2019s voice is vital,\u201d Demissie said in a statement. \u201cWe still have a long way to go over the next 8 days to reach our $1.7 million goal -- but the past two days have shown the power of people rallying together to take on tough challenges. It\u2019s the same spirit that will beat Donald Trump and change this country.\u201d The young climate activist Greta Thunberg denounced inaction on combating climate change in her address to the UN General Assembly, saying the gathered leaders had \u201cstolen my dreams.\u201d Reuters has more: Thunberg, visibly emotional, said in shaky but stern remarks at the opening of the summit that the generations that have polluted the most have burdened her and her generation with the extreme impacts of climate change. \u2018This is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you,\u2019 she said. \u2018You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\u2019 Thunberg said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who convened the [UN Climate Action Summit], had warned governments ahead of the event that they would have to offer action plans to qualify to speak at the summit, which is aimed at boosting the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat global warming. Trump is currently speaking at a UN General Assembly session on protecting religious freedom. But a PBS NewsHour reporter noted that the president sidestepped some of his own past comments on the topic. Trump has taken his attention away from the UN General Assembly long enough to fire off this two-part tweet questioning the allegiance of the whistleblower who raised concerns about the president\u2019s phone call with the leader of Ukraine. There is no evidence of the whistleblower having ties to another country, as the president seems to be suggesting here. And it\u2019s also worth noting that Trump has now confirmed he discussed Joe Biden during his phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, so it\u2019s unclear what the president is denying he did here. Trump made an unscheduled appearance at the UN General Assembly\u2019s climate session, per a Wall Street Journal reporter. Trump had been criticized for scheduling an appearance at a religious freedom event at the same time as the climate session, but he told reporters yesterday that he was sincerely concerned about climate change. \u201cThe floods are very important to me, and uh, climate change \u2013 everything is very important,\u201d Trump said. The president was criticized last month for skipping a climate session at the G-7 summit in France, as his administration simultaneously rolls back a number of environmental regulations. It appears Trump\u2019s comments on impeachment upon arrival to the UN General Assembly were overheard by another one of the gathering\u2019s most famous guests \u2013 the young climate activist Greta Thunberg. The White House is reportedly giving serious consideration to releasing the transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, despite concerns about the precedent it could set. CNN reports: However, some senior administration officials, like Secretary of State Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, are against the idea because of the precedent releasing it could set with future foreign leaders \u2014 and because putting it out could give Congress ammunition to demand transcripts of Trump\u2019s calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin. White House officials were soliciting opinions from outside advisers over the weekend about whether they should release the transcript of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, as well as how advisers think the White House should message it if the transcript was \u2018embarrassing.\u2019 A person familiar with the discussions said the White House Counsel\u2019s Office is currently involved in evaluating whether the transcript should be released and in what form. The person saying the release could happen \u2018soon.\u2019 A Politico reporter noted that Trump\u2019s comments on his phone call with the Ukrainian president may indicate that the possibility of withholding military aid from the country was under consideration: Trump answered a question on what he told the Ukrainian president about Joe Biden by saying, \u201cYou are going to see.\u201d The answer may indicate the White House is leaning toward releasing a transcript of the phone call between the president and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as Trump himself suggested yesterday. But Democratic lawmakers are unlikely to relent in their demands for details on the call until they receive the whistleblower complaint that kicked off this controversy. Arriving at the UN General Assembly in New York, Trump said he was talking Democrats\u2019 talk of impeachment \u201cnot at all seriously.\u201d The president also dubiously argued that his conversation with the Ukrainian leader was appropriate given the importance of discussing corruption. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? ... It\u2019s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d But it\u2019s one thing to bring up a country\u2019s history with corruption and quite another to suggest that the country investigate one of your political rivals. The Senate\u2019s top Democrat is now pushing the chamber\u2019s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to request access to the whistleblower complaint about Trump allegedly pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden. But it\u2019s highly unlikely McConnell will give any credence to Chuck Schumer\u2019s request. With Republicans in control of the Senate and few of its caucus members coming out to demand the information, McConnell is much more likely to try to avoid the issue in the hope that it will eventually go away. With Democrats in control of the House, though, the issue is bound to stay in the spotlight for the foreseeable future. The eye-popping statistic of the day: nearly 40 percent of House Republicans are leaving or have been pushed out of office since Trump became president. The Washington Post reports: Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, a Washington Post analysis shows, nearly 40 percent of the 241 Republicans who were in office in January 2017 are gone or leaving because of election losses, retirements including former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), and some, such as [Michigan\u2019s Paul] Mitchell, who are simply quitting in disgust. ... The retirement numbers are particularly staggering. All told, 41 House Republicans have left national politics or announced they won\u2019t seek reelection in the nearly three years since Trump took office. That dwarfs the 25 Democrats who retired in the first four years of former president Barack Obama\u2019s tenure \u2014 and Republicans privately predict this is only the beginning. Most of the departing Republicans publicly cite family as the reason for leaving. But behind the scenes, Republicans say the trend highlights a greater pessimism about the direction of the party under Trump \u2014 and their ability to win back the House next year. Pivoting back to the Democratic campaign trail: presidential candidate Pete Buttigeig announced his second television ad buy in Iowa, the nation\u2019s first caucus state. The ad, entitled \u201cHad To,\u201d focuses on Buttigieg\u2019s biography as an Afghanistan War veteran and Indiana mayor. \u201cServing in Afghanistan, we had to be united in our mission,\u201d Buttigieg says in the ad. \u201cAfter corporate greed ripped apart the rust belt, my city had to find a way forward. Whenever I visit, I hear Iowans\u2019 frustration with politics so broken for so long.\u201d The latest CNN/Des Moines Register poll from Iowa shows Buttigieg holding steady in the state, attracting the support of 9 percent of Democratic voters. The number puts him ahead of Kamala Harris and just behind Bernie Sanders, who received 11 percent. Rudy Giuliani, who serves as a lawyer to Trump, was asked on Fox News about whether the president threatened to cut off aid to the Ukraine if the country did not investigate Joe Biden. The former New York mayor initially denied the reports as a \u201cfalse story.\u201d But when pressed on whether it was \u201c100 percent\u201d false, Giuliani said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s 100 percent.\u201d According to reports, Trump repeatedly pressured the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to work with Giuliani on a probe into Biden. Giuliani has previously suggested that Biden leaned on Ukraine to stomp out corruption because of an investigation into a natural gas company with connections to his son, Hunter Biden. But there is no evidence of wrongdoing on the younger Biden\u2019s part. That has not stopped Giuliani from cranking out baseless conspiracy theories apparently meant to try to deflect attention away from Trump. Even some Republican lawmakers are acknowledging that Trump should release the details of his phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the president can share, in an appropriate way, information to deal with the drama around the phone call,\u201d said Republican senator Lindsey Graham, a close congressional ally of the president\u2019s. \u201cI think it would be good for the country if we could deal with it.\u201d Senator Mitt Romney, the Republican senator of Utah, said it was \u201ccritical for the facts to come out.\u201d He added, \u201cIf the president asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme.\u201d Of course, this is a far cry from comments from many Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have warned that Trump\u2019s reported phone call could pose a constitutional threat. Bill Weld, the former Massachusetts governor who has launched a long-shot bid against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, said the president\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian leader pressing him to investigate Joe Biden constitutes \u201ctreason.\u201d \u201cTalk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election,\u201d Weld told MSNBC. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be clearer, and that\u2019s not just undermining democratic institutions. That is treason. It\u2019s treason, pure and simple, and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That\u2019s the only penalty.\u201d Weld added that, if Trump has committed treason, then the president has well crossed the threshold to be removed from office. Some of the most senior House Democrats are ratcheting up their comments on impeaching Trump, even as they avoid calling for immediately launching proceedings. Nancy Pelosi, who has stridently avoided calling for impeachment, wrote in a letter that continued White House obstruction over releasing the whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president would trigger severe consequences. \u201cIf the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President, they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation,\u201d the House speaker wrote. And the House intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, said yesterday that impeachment \u201cmay be the only remedy\u201d if Trump refuses to release the complaint alleging that he discussed one of his political rivals, Joe Biden, with the Ukrainian president. \u201cIf the president is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that conduct represents,\u201d the California Democrat told CNN. The real test will come Thursday, when acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testifies publicly before the House Intelligence Committee. Good morning, live blog readers! Most eyes will be turned to Washington this week as talks intensify over whether House Democrats will move forward with impeachment now that Donald Trump has acknowledged he discussed one of his political rivals, Joe Biden, in a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s new president. But developments are continuing far away from Washington as well, specifically in the early voting states of the Democratic presidential primary. A new poll released this weekend found Elizabeth Warren edging out Biden in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa. According to the CNN/Des Moines Register poll, the Massachusetts senator is attracting the support of 22 percent of Iowa Democrats, compared to the former vice president\u2019s 20 percent. But what\u2019s arguably even more surprising about the results is how much every other candidate, including Bernie Sanders, has fallen behind the two front-runners. Most political commentators initially viewed the Democratic primary as a four-person race between Biden, Sanders, Warren and Kamala Harris. When Harris\u2019 polling started to dip this summer, it looked like a three-person race. Could it now become a one-on-one face-off? It\u2019s just one poll, and time will tell with more than four months left before the Iowa caucus, but Biden and Warren are currently the candidates to beat. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump is in New York for the UN General Assembly, where he will meet with a number of world leaders \u2013 including his \u201cfavorite dictator,\u201d Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Joe Biden and Jill Biden will attend the funeral service for Emily Clyburn, the wife of Democratic representative Jim Clyburn who died last week, in South Carolina. Here in DC, climate activists are attempting to shut down some of the city\u2019s major intersections to demand action on climate change. The blog is watching all of that, so stay tuned.",
