That\u2019s a word I\u2019ve not heard for a very long time. Ever since the 1960s, we have been told that rebellion is an end in itself. Politeness, manners, reserve, honour, understatement, rules \u2013 all of these were stuffy, outmoded, Victorian hang-ups. Deference was repression. Convention was a straitjacket.

Dominic Cummings has been \u201cin contempt of parliament\u201d? Join the queue!</p> <p>It is strange to see that people who for decades demanded that parliament be burned as a hidebound imperialist relic are rushing to defend its integrity now it is convenient for them. I ask all progressives belatedly hand-wringing about Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bullishness: are you truly appalled at his lack of decorum and disrespect for precedent or are you just frustrated that he is beating you at your own game?<br><strong>Robert Frazer</strong><br>Salford, Greater Manchester<br></p> <h2>Drawing the line on Kashmir<br></h2> <p>While you are right to condemn India for unilaterally altering Kashmir\u2019s status quo, it was Pakistan, not India, which made the first move in this direction (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/11/observer-view-on-kashmir-india-pakistan\" title=\"\">Modi\u2019s acts go unchecked in an ever more lawless world</a>\u201d, Comment). In 1963, Pakistan, under the Sino-Pakistan agreement, decided unilaterally to cede a large portion of Kashmir\u2019s territory to China. It acted unilaterally again when, in May 2018, it decided to allow China to build an economic corridor through the Gilgit-Baltistan area of Kashmir, although such construction is illegal under international law.</p> <p>Both India and Pakistan have been guilty of altering Kashmir\u2019s status quo unilaterally over the last 70 years. Under these circumstances, is it not time that, instead of prolonging this dispute for another 70 years, they considered ending it by converting the current line of control in Kashmir into an international border between the two countries?<br><strong>Randhir Singh Bains</strong><br>Gants Hill, Essex<br></p> <h2>A leaf out of Merkel\u2019s book<br></h2> <p>Rebecca Nicholson mocks Angela Merkel for choosing as her holiday reading Stephen Greenblatt\u2019s <em>Tyranny</em> (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/10/angela-merkel-on-hols-less-despotism-please\" title=\"\">You\u2019re on hols, so less of the despotic reading matter</a>\u201d, Comment). As Simon Callow put it in his <em>New York Times</em> review of the book, <em>Tyranny</em> \u201canalyses political events in Shakespeare\u2019s world in terms of our own experience\u201d and in so doing subtly explains a great deal about Donald Trump.</p> <p>The book sounds like ideal holiday reading for a head of government who possesses the considerable intelligence and cultural sophistication of an Angela Merkel, who at school was East Germany\u2019s three-time champion in the national Russian-language competition, was to go on to be awarded a PhD in quantum chemistry and regularly enjoys Wagner operas at Bayreuth.</p> <p>Furthermore, such a book is tailor-made for the mind of a leader who has shown that she has the measure of Donald Trump and is not afraid to stand up to him, for instance by recently saying that she firmly distanced herself from Trump\u2019s racist attack on four Congresswomen of colour.</p> <p>It is foolish to ridicule anyone with a significant intellectual hinterland for not choosing to immerse themselves in trivia when taking a break from work. I would find it reassuring if any of the UK\u2019s MPs expressed vacation interest in the political world of Friedrich Schiller\u2019s works. They are more likely to court popular opinion by tweeting about <em>Love Island</em>, which, I suspect, partly explains the mess we are in. Give me the intellectual curiosity of Angela Merkel on holiday any day.<br><strong>David Head</strong><br>Peterborough<br></p>",

Politeness, manners, reserve, honour, understatement, rules \u2013 all of these were stuffy, outmoded, Victorian hang-ups. Deference was repression. Convention was a straitjacket. All were regressive controlling tools of patriarchy and enemies to be destroyed in class war. This social campaign to slaughter a previous generation\u2019s sacred cows was so triumphant it\u2019s a victim of its own success \u2013 what was once counter-culture is now conventional culture, and the new rebels have taken its lessons to heart. If Rawnsley is disappointed that people do not \u201cbehave properly\u201d, it is the natural consequence of the perpetual state of adolescent revolt our culture has pushed for years. Dominic Cummings has been \u201cin contempt of parliament\u201d? Join the queue! It is strange to see that people who for decades demanded that parliament be burned as a hidebound imperialist relic are rushing to defend its integrity now it is convenient for them. I ask all progressives belatedly hand-wringing about Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bullishness: are you truly appalled at his lack of decorum and disrespect for precedent or are you just frustrated that he is beating you at your own game? Robert Frazer Salford, Greater Manchester Drawing the line on Kashmir While you are right to condemn India for unilaterally altering Kashmir\u2019s status quo, it was Pakistan, not India, which made the first move in this direction (\u201cModi\u2019s acts go unchecked in an ever more lawless world\u201d, Comment). In 1963, Pakistan, under the Sino-Pakistan agreement, decided unilaterally to cede a large portion of Kashmir\u2019s territory to China. It acted unilaterally again when, in May 2018, it decided to allow China to build an economic corridor through the Gilgit-Baltistan area of Kashmir, although such construction is illegal under international law. Both India and Pakistan have been guilty of altering Kashmir\u2019s status quo unilaterally over the last 70 years. Under these circumstances, is it not time that, instead of prolonging this dispute for another 70 years, they considered ending it by converting the current line of control in Kashmir into an international border between the two countries? Randhir Singh Bains Gants Hill, Essex A leaf out of Merkel\u2019s book Rebecca Nicholson mocks Angela Merkel for choosing as her holiday reading Stephen Greenblatt\u2019s Tyranny (\u201cYou\u2019re on hols, so less of the despotic reading matter\u201d, Comment). As Simon Callow put it in his New York Times review of the book, Tyranny \u201canalyses political events in Shakespeare\u2019s world in terms of our own experience\u201d and in so doing subtly explains a great deal about Donald Trump. The book sounds like ideal holiday reading for a head of government who possesses the considerable intelligence and cultural sophistication of an Angela Merkel, who at school was East Germany\u2019s three-time champion in the national Russian-language competition, was to go on to be awarded a PhD in quantum chemistry and regularly enjoys Wagner operas at Bayreuth. Furthermore, such a book is tailor-made for the mind of a leader who has shown that she has the measure of Donald Trump and is not afraid to stand up to him, for instance by recently saying that she firmly distanced herself from Trump\u2019s racist attack on four Congresswomen of colour. It is foolish to ridicule anyone with a significant intellectual hinterland for not choosing to immerse themselves in trivia when taking a break from work. I would find it reassuring if any of the UK\u2019s MPs expressed vacation interest in the political world of Friedrich Schiller\u2019s works. They are more likely to court popular opinion by tweeting about Love Island, which, I suspect, partly explains the mess we are in. Give me the intellectual curiosity of Angela Merkel on holiday any day. David Head Peterborough",
