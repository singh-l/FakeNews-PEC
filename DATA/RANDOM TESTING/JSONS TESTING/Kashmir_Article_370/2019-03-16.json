In 2016 residents in the Canadian city of Windsor were plagued by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/07/windsor-hum-canada-zug-island-united-states\">puzzling </a>noise. A study later confirmed it was likely to be coming from a US Steel plant\u2019s blast furnace operations on nearby Zug island.</p> <p>This week readers proposed theories about what the mysterious worldwide hum is and several, more sceptical readers, cast doubt on the idea that it exists at all. While there was debate about whether the hum is in fact tinnitus, Glen MacPherson, a mathematics, physics, psychology, and Russian Language teacher and former Mathematics Education lecturer at the University of British Columbia (UBC), who has been investigating the Hum\u2019s source, said: \u201cAs several posters mentioned, classic tinnitus is profoundly different from the Worldwide Hum.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWhile it must be stressed time and again that there are many sounds created by human activity that can sound like the Hum, and it takes some effort and knowledge to track those sounds down. They range from electrical noise, pumps, industrial machinery, and so on. Once we eliminate those sources, we are left with the worldwide phenomenon that I am studying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGenuine\u201d Hum hearers, or not, here\u2019s what our readers had to say on the matter:</p> <h2>What does it sound like?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/13/what-is-the-mysterious-gl-hum-and-is-it-simply-noise-pollution#comment-126832304\">Ozonelayer</a> I used to live in central Liverpool and could often hear this strange hum in the middle of a quiet night, though my partner never could. To me, it sounded like a large diesel engine, probably a ship or a train both of which would be close by. However, after \u201csuffering\u201d this for months at a time I decided to do proper research into ship and train movements to try and isolate the cause \u2013 discovering that it was neither.</p> <h2>Some ruled out tinnitus</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/13/what-is-the-mysterious-gl-hum-and-is-it-simply-noise-pollution#comment-126806269\">timbomachino </a>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tinnitus because that\u2019s a very high frequency sound. I think we\u2019re talking about 18Hz or lower, which is around the area of the fattest cathedral organ pipe. Those pipes are designed to be more \u201cfelt\u201d than heard. However, because the frequency is right on the edge of human hearing, and we\u2019re all different, only some of us can hear it. Whatever it is, and wherever it comes from, it\u2019s bloody annoying if you can hear it.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/13/what-is-the-mysterious-gl-hum-and-is-it-simply-noise-pollution#comment-126862434\">Jaybee UK</a> I moved to Bristol six years ago and started hearing this. Have been following the subject avidly since and very familiar with Glen\u2019s research. For all those flippantly pointing the finger at tinnitus, or some other yet unexplained internally produced phenomenon, explain this: I can completely eliminate the hum by using silicon ear plugs. The hum I hear is largely omnipresent but only indoors. Often it starts at a certain time, usually between 2200-0100 but it also can be present throughout the day. It\u2019s around the range of 50-60Hz.</p> <h2>Many have been left mystified by it</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sjallison/status/1105951289765257221\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have heard this on Hampstead Heath in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/london?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#london</a>.

I heard it three or four times in the \u201870s. Each time it was at a different outdoor spot in Singapore. It wasn\u2019t tinnitus or from within but out there.

I live in a high rise apartment near Sydney\u2019s CBD, and a stone\u2019s throw from the Southern Cross Drive, which I have long considered to be the cause. Interesting that one hypothesis mentioned in this article is high-speed traffic. The sound is like a low frequency hum of a propeller driven airplane that oscillates between a louder and a softer hum.

      "bodyText": "Some of you first heard it in the 70s. One of you heard it on a hot summer\u2019s day on Hampstead Heath, in London. And one of you even wrote a poem about it. On Wednesday Philip Jaekl reported on a mysterious phenomenon known as the Hum. Up to 4% of people around the world are thought to hear the strange, low-pitched noise. Its actual source is unknown, though many hearers are in urban areas, suggesting it could be some form of noise pollution. Anecdotes came thick and fast as \u201chum hearers\u201d shared their experiences and tried to describe it. \u201cAn endless riff of heavy metal music \u2026 difficult to say if felt or heard,\u201d said one. \u201cAn unmistakable mechanical \u2018whirring\u2019 hum,\u201d said another. Locations varied \u2013 from the Cheshire countryside in the UK, to Chichagof Island off the coast of Alaska to a high-rise apartment block in Sydney, Australia. It\u2019s not the first time a hum has hit the headlines. In 2016 residents in the Canadian city of Windsor were plagued by a puzzling noise. A study later confirmed it was likely to be coming from a US Steel plant\u2019s blast furnace operations on nearby Zug island. This week readers proposed theories about what the mysterious worldwide hum is and several, more sceptical readers, cast doubt on the idea that it exists at all. While there was debate about whether the hum is in fact tinnitus, Glen MacPherson, a mathematics, physics, psychology, and Russian Language teacher and former Mathematics Education lecturer at the University of British Columbia (UBC), who has been investigating the Hum\u2019s source, said: \u201cAs several posters mentioned, classic tinnitus is profoundly different from the Worldwide Hum.\u201d He added: \u201cWhile it must be stressed time and again that there are many sounds created by human activity that can sound like the Hum, and it takes some effort and knowledge to track those sounds down. They range from electrical noise, pumps, industrial machinery, and so on. Once we eliminate those sources, we are left with the worldwide phenomenon that I am studying.\u201d \u201cGenuine\u201d Hum hearers, or not, here\u2019s what our readers had to say on the matter: What does it sound like? Ozonelayer I used to live in central Liverpool and could often hear this strange hum in the middle of a quiet night, though my partner never could. To me, it sounded like a large diesel engine, probably a ship or a train both of which would be close by. However, after \u201csuffering\u201d this for months at a time I decided to do proper research into ship and train movements to try and isolate the cause \u2013 discovering that it was neither. Some ruled out tinnitus timbomachino I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tinnitus because that\u2019s a very high frequency sound. I think we\u2019re talking about 18Hz or lower, which is around the area of the fattest cathedral organ pipe. Those pipes are designed to be more \u201cfelt\u201d than heard. However, because the frequency is right on the edge of human hearing, and we\u2019re all different, only some of us can hear it. Whatever it is, and wherever it comes from, it\u2019s bloody annoying if you can hear it. Jaybee UK I moved to Bristol six years ago and started hearing this. Have been following the subject avidly since and very familiar with Glen\u2019s research. For all those flippantly pointing the finger at tinnitus, or some other yet unexplained internally produced phenomenon, explain this: I can completely eliminate the hum by using silicon ear plugs. The hum I hear is largely omnipresent but only indoors. Often it starts at a certain time, usually between 2200-0100 but it also can be present throughout the day. It\u2019s around the range of 50-60Hz. Many have been left mystified by it Nancyloh So glad to know there\u2019s a name for it! I heard it three or four times in the \u201870s. Each time it was at a different outdoor spot in Singapore. It wasn\u2019t tinnitus or from within but out there. It was quite a loud and unmistakable mechanical \u201cwhirring\u201d hum. The person I was with heard it too, and we joked about UFOS. CitizenGlenn Yes, I have heard the \u201cHum\u201d ... I live in a high rise apartment near Sydney\u2019s CBD, and a stone\u2019s throw from the Southern Cross Drive, which I have long considered to be the cause. Interesting that one hypothesis mentioned in this article is high-speed traffic. The sound is like a low frequency hum of a propeller driven airplane that oscillates between a louder and a softer hum. At first, I thought it was an old DC3 or similar circling overhead, but it wasn\u2019t that. I don\u2019t hear it often but when I do, it is quite noticeable.
