But my initial passion for human rights stemmed from my first trip to India in the year before I started at UWE Bristol. I taught English in Kashmir and noticed children, particularly girls, often skipped classes. I later realised it was down to water-related illnesses. Then I got dysentery myself, from the unclean water, and was so ill that I lost about two stone in four months.</p> <p>After that, I started at UWE Bristol. While I was there I learned about different cultures through my course and in the process of working on my art.

Along with funding, the base at Future Space gave us the capacity to make vital advancements with MekaMon and start to strike out as a startup business. In short, we couldn\u2019t have done it without them.</p>",

Throughout the course, I got a full understanding of robotics, which has helped me get to where I am today. As chief executive of Reach Robotics, there\u2019s a lot of joy in having a vision and seeing it through to the hands of our customers. We go on this journey with them and see them fall in love with the robots \u2013 that\u2019s a satisfaction you can\u2019t get anywhere else. Some of the highlights are seeing videos of customers viewing our robots for the first time and them being just wowed by them. Over the years I\u2019ve spent running the company I\u2019ve met a lot of amazingly talented people. It\u2019s the team you work with that makes all the difference, and my two co-founders have been enjoying running and developing the business. Throughout the process, UWE Bristol has been there to support us and shout about what we\u2019re doing. In the early stages, they helped by providing us with desk space and we also got funding through the university. And their support hasn\u2019t stopped there. One of my lecturers is still an adviser to the company, so they\u2019ve been able to see the growth of the business, as well as my personal growth. Reach Robotics took its first steps in UWE. Along with funding, the base at Future Space gave us the capacity to make vital advancements with MekaMon and start to strike out as a startup business. In short, we couldn\u2019t have done it without them.",
