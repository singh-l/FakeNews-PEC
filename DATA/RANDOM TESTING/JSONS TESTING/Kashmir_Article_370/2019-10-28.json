I just wish the leave brigade would show me the blueprint for how this country intends to jerk dramatically back into life to face global competition. David Redshaw Gravesend, Kent \u2022 I read with some bemusement the contention by Larry Elliot that membership of the EU has done nothing for worker health and safety. The most significant piece of health and safety legislation in the past 30 years is the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1992, emanating solely from the EU. It enshrined in statute the concept of risk assessment, a simple but spectacularly successful idea that employers should consider the hazards of their undertaking and take steps to eliminate or reduce them prior to being put on notice by an accident. The terms of the EC directive make it plain that the motivation was to reduce the high level of workplace injury throughout Europe, at the same time as ensuring that no member country obtained an unfair economic and competitive advantage by a race to the bottom. As a result fatal injuries in the UK workplace have reduced from 425 in 1989 to an average over the last three years of 141 per annum. Non-fatal injuries have reduced by 58% since 1986. These figures are in the public domain on the Health and Safety Executive website.

However, the issue now is that \u201cprotecting workers\u2019 rights under Brexit\u201d is really a code for saying that we must resist the plan of Boris Johnson and the right to turn the UK into an offshore enterprise zone with minimum workers\u2019 rights, undercutting European workers and driving their conditions down in a race to the bottom.
