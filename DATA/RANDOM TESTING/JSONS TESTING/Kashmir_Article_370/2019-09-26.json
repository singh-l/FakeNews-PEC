      "bodyText": "The plea from the Labour MP Paula Sherriff for Boris Johnson and others to tone down their political rhetoric has returned the focus to the daily threats of violence faced by public figures. Are threats to public figures on the rise? Earlier this year, Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, told parliamentarians the number of threats to MPs had risen significantly. In the first five months of 2019, MPs reported 152 crimes to the police, who also received reports of another 600 incidents involving MPs. This is a 90% rise on the same period last year and the Met has predicted that if the trend continues, more than 450 crimes will be reported by the end of the year. In 2018, the number of crimes reported by MPs more than doubled from 151 in 2017 to 342. Dick said female MPs and MPs from ethnic minorities were disproportionately targeted, and about 10 MPs accounted for 29% of reports. How can the threats be dealt with? A range of charges can be used to tackle threats of violence, including making a threat to kill, sending malicious communications, or harassment. Threatening to kill is at the most serious end of such offending, carrying a potential 10-year prison sentence, but the charge is rarely used. Earlier this year, the Met commander Adrian Usher, told MPs: \u201cIt is a notoriously difficult offence to prove because it contains an element of intent, and as soon as we get into intent as a point to prove, my own experience in the courts is that that is very difficult.\u201d More commonly, offenders are convicted of harassment or malicious communications. Has any action been taken? There have been a number of successful prosecutions. Robert Vidler was jailed for 18 weeks after being convicted in August on three counts of sending menacing or obscene messages and five counts of harassment. He sent voicemails to several MPs saying he knew where they lived and their movements, and threatening to kill them. He sent Nick Boles, the independent MP for Grantham, a voicemail threatening to cut his throat \u201cif you fuck up Brexit\u201d. David Stuart, who was convicted in May on two counts of sending a threatening communication, received a 36-week prison sentence suspended for two years.

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Impeachment poses dangers to Trump and Democrats In an apparent attempt to have the first word in a looming impeachment inquiry, the White House released a memo on Wednesday detailing Donald Trump\u2019s phone call in July with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate his Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden, and appeared to tie the request to US aid for Ukraine. Trump also attacked the anonymous intelligence official responsible for bringing the conversation to light, a move intended to dissuade future whistleblowers. Risky business. Trump\u2019s aura of invincibility at last appears to have been dented, writes Tom McCarthy. But, as Lauren Gambino reports, the impeachment process also carries risks for the Democrats. Unintended comedy. Trump came face to face with a seemingly bewildered Zelenskiy at the UN general assembly in New York, where the two former TV stars met on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the White House mistakenly emailed its talking points on the scandal to Democratic leaders. Fired EPA scientists to reconvene in snub to Trump An advisory panel of 20 air pollution scientists dismissed from the Environmental Protection Agency by the Trump administration intends to reconvene and continue its work outside government, assembling at a Washington DC hotel a year to the day since its official disbandment. The Guardian has learned Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Fish and Wildlife Service, Aurelia Skipwith, has ties to agricultural groups opposed to protections for endangered species. Indigenous representative. An indigenous representative has addressed the UN climate summit in a formal capacity for the first time. Tuntiak Katan of the Ecuadorian Shuar people told the event indigenous peoples \u201cprotect 80% of the world\u2019s biodiversity\u201d. Climate deniers. A group of Australian mining engineers and business figures has signed up to a declaration claiming \u201cthere is no climate emergency\u201d and insisting \u201cCO2 is plant food\u201d. LA police enabled Ed Buck by \u2018ignoring gay black men\u2019 Ed Buck, a prominent Los Angeles political activist who stands accused of forcibly injecting black gay men with fatal doses of methamphetamine, got away with his crimes because the police ignored evidence and the testimony of the black gay men who spoke up, the mother of one of his victims has claimed. LaTisha Nixon\u2019s 26-year-old son, Gemmel Moore, died from an overdose at Buck\u2019s West Hollywood apartment in July 2017. \u201cI\u2019m a grieving mother, but [law enforcement treated us like criminals,\u201d she said. \u2018Violent predator\u2019. Buck, 65, was arrested last week. Prosecutors called him a \u201cviolent sexual predator\u201d who had at least 11 victims, two of whom died, including Timothy Dean, who had a fatal overdose at Buck\u2019s home in January. Boris Johnson urged to calm \u2018inferno of rhetoric\u2019 British MPs on the left and right have urged the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to temper his rhetoric over Brexit after an acrimonious return to the House of Commons on Wednesday. Following the UK supreme court\u2019s ruling that the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen to suspend parliament was unlawful, an unrepentant Johnson dismissed the suggestion his use of inflammatory language such as \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d was dangerous as \u201chumbug\u201d. Jo Cox. Johnson drew gasps of shock in the Commons when he referred to the Labour MP Jo Cox, an ardent remainer murdered in the run-up to the Brexit vote in 2016. Johnson claimed the best way to honour Cox\u2019s memory was to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Cheat sheet Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has said he is trying to draw international attention to the danger of war breaking out between his country and India, which both have nuclear weapons, over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, has asked Benjamin Netanyahu to try to form a coalition government, in an effort to break the deadlock between the incumbent prime minister and opposition leader Benny Gantz, after the country\u2019s inconclusive election. Elizabeth Warren has topped a national poll of Democratic presidential candidates for the first time, in a Quinnipiac survey that puts the Massachusetts senator on 27% to Biden\u2019s 25%, with Bernie Sanders trailing on 16%. Samuel L Jackson has signed up to be the first celebrity voice of Alexa, Amazon\u2019s virtual personal assistant, allowing users to interact with an AI version of the Pulp Fiction star, developed using the company\u2019s neural text-to-speech technology. Must-reads Zero stars for Zeroville, the worst film of 2019 James Franco had directed several little-seen literary adaptations, including two based onbooks by William Faulkner, before tackling the dense Hollywood novel Zeroville in 2014. Finally released on three US screens this month, his film version is \u201ca work of rarefied and powerful badness,\u201d says Charles Bramesco. Life as a cancer patient When Anne Boyer was diagnosed with highly aggressive breast cancer, she was offered a cure so poisonous that, if she survived, she could lose her eyesight, speech and memory. \u201cMy body feels like it is dying as a side-effect of what is promised to keep it alive,\u201d she writes. Buttigieg faces new criticism from South Bend\u2019s black leaders The South Bend mayor, Pete Buttigieg, was the rising star of the Democratic presidential primary, until his progress was hindered by the fallout from a police shooting in his city in March. Now, he is again being criticised by some of the city\u2019s black leaders over policing-related controversies, as Tom Perkins reports. Trudeau\u2019s poor constituents \u2018pushed out\u2019 by development As if Justin Trudeau were not facing enough controversy on the national stage, trouble is brewing in his Montreal constituency, too. Parc-Extension is one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Canada. Now, writes Flavie Halais, some fear a new C$348m ($263m) university campus will gentrify the district beyond recognition. Opinion Women still earn less than men, but the work environment is changing slowly for the better, says Gene Marks. And nothing sends that message more clearly than a survey that found 42% of US businesses are owned by women. In what could be a response to lower pay at their place of employment, more women than ever \u2013 particularly women of color \u2013 are also starting up side businesses. Sport England\u2019s plan for their Rugby World Cup tie against the USA in Japan on Thursday is to get the job done as simply and effectively as possible. But the Eagles, featuring several seasoned pros such as Joe Taufete\u2019e, will not necessarily make it easy for them, says Robert Kitson.

India has been resistant to outside mediation, and Modi has presented his actions in Indian-controlled Kashmir as essential to counter separatism and terrorism, which he accuses Pakistan of fomenting.</p> <p>But Khan has faced an uphill task. Trump has become a close political ally of Modi, even appearing as the Indian prime minister\u2019s guest last Sunday at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/23/modi-defends-removing-kashmirs-autonomy-at-trump-rally\">a Texas rally</a> of some Indian Americans. But on Monday, Trump described some of Modi\u2019s rhetoric as \u201cvery aggressive\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have tried my best,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhat options do we have? What do we do? Do we just wait for this nightmare scenario to unfold and hope that nothing happens.\u201d</p> <p>In Kashmir, residents are watching the developments at the UN closely. \u201cI hope the UN does something that helps Kashmir otherwise generations of our sacrifices will be ruined,\u201d said Mohammad Ramzan, who lives in Pulwama, south Kashmir.</p> <p>\u201cAt least my generation saw good days and also the bad days. But I fear for the future of my sons and daughters,\u201d he said as he visited his son in Srinagar, Kashmir\u2019s main city. \u201cWe are now caught between an abyss and a fire,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In parts of south Kashmir, which has been the epicentre of new generation of anti-India insurgents, local residents said militants had asked for a complete shutdown until Friday\u2019s meeting, when Khan and Modi are both expected to address the annual session in New York.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not sure if the militants have actually said it or not, but no one is willing to take a risk,\u201d added Ramzan. Shops in South Kashmir remain shut and roads mostly empty.</p> <p>Some are sceptical that the UN meeting will lead to progress. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will happen. At the end it is our fight, no one else will come to fight it,\u201d said a shopkeeper in Srinagar, who asked to remain anonymous.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Khan said he had been asked by both the US and Saudi Arabia to act as a mediator with Iran.</p> <p>\u201cPresident Trump asked me and also Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked me to speak to the Iranians, and we are trying our best that this should not develop into a conflict,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThe good thing about President Trump is that I feel he\u2019s not a pro-war person, although I can see that there are others who are egging him on. But his instinct, quite rightly is not for war ... I think that\u2019s very admirable.\u201d</p>",

Trump has offered to mediate, but only if both Pakistan and India agree. India has been resistant to outside mediation, and Modi has presented his actions in Indian-controlled Kashmir as essential to counter separatism and terrorism, which he accuses Pakistan of fomenting. But Khan has faced an uphill task. Trump has become a close political ally of Modi, even appearing as the Indian prime minister\u2019s guest last Sunday at a Texas rally of some Indian Americans. But on Monday, Trump described some of Modi\u2019s rhetoric as \u201cvery aggressive\u201d. \u201cI have tried my best,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhat options do we have? What do we do? Do we just wait for this nightmare scenario to unfold and hope that nothing happens.\u201d In Kashmir, residents are watching the developments at the UN closely. \u201cI hope the UN does something that helps Kashmir otherwise generations of our sacrifices will be ruined,\u201d said Mohammad Ramzan, who lives in Pulwama, south Kashmir. \u201cAt least my generation saw good days and also the bad days. But I fear for the future of my sons and daughters,\u201d he said as he visited his son in Srinagar, Kashmir\u2019s main city. \u201cWe are now caught between an abyss and a fire,\u201d he said. In parts of south Kashmir, which has been the epicentre of new generation of anti-India insurgents, local residents said militants had asked for a complete shutdown until Friday\u2019s meeting, when Khan and Modi are both expected to address the annual session in New York. \u201cWe are not sure if the militants have actually said it or not, but no one is willing to take a risk,\u201d added Ramzan. Shops in South Kashmir remain shut and roads mostly empty. Some are sceptical that the UN meeting will lead to progress. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will happen. At the end it is our fight, no one else will come to fight it,\u201d said a shopkeeper in Srinagar, who asked to remain anonymous. Meanwhile, Khan said he had been asked by both the US and Saudi Arabia to act as a mediator with Iran. \u201cPresident Trump asked me and also Prince Mohammed bin Salman asked me to speak to the Iranians, and we are trying our best that this should not develop into a conflict,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThe good thing about President Trump is that I feel he\u2019s not a pro-war person, although I can see that there are others who are egging him on. But his instinct, quite rightly is not for war ... I think that\u2019s very admirable.\u201d",
