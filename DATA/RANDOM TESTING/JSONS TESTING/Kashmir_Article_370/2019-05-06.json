      "bodyText": "Sydney newspaper the Daily Telegraph is appealing the decision in the high-profile defamation case brought against it by Oscar-winning actor Geoffrey Rush. In April federal court justice Michael Wigney ordered News Corp to pay more than $850,000 \u2013 with the prospect of millions more \u2013 to Rush after finding the Daily Telegraph defamed the actor by alleging he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d during a theatre production of King Lear. In his judgment, Wigney said the reports in the Daily Telegraph were \u201cin all the circumstances, a recklessly irresponsible piece of sensationalist journalism of the worst kind\u201d. He said the evidence given against Rush by his Lear co-star Eryn Jean Norvill was uncorroborated by fellow cast members and found she was \u201cprone to exaggeration and embellishment\u201d. On Monday the Daily Telegraph reported the newspaper had filed an appeal, citing 16 grounds upon which it claims the trial was miscarried and that Wigney\u2019s conduct of the case \u201cgave rise to an apprehension of bias\u201d. According to the Daily Telegraph its appeal document says Wigney\u2019s bias was on display in finding \u201cthat Ms Norvill was an unreliable witness prone to exaggeration and lacking in credibility\u201d. The judge\u2019s assessment of Norvill\u2019s character is one of 16 appeal grounds in support of the newspaper\u2019s claim \u201cthat the conduct of the proceedings by the primary judge gave rise to an apprehension of bias\u201d, the Daily Telegraph reports. The Daily Telegraph front-page story, published under the headline \u201cKing Leer\u201d in November 2017, reported the Sydney Theatre Company had received the anonymous complaint but provided no further details. Follow-up articles were published the next day, which Wigney said \u201cdoubled down\u201d on the story. Rush sued the newspaper and journalist Jonathon Moran, claiming the articles conveyed the imputation that he was a \u201cpervert\u201d, a \u201csexual predator\u201d and \u201ccommitted sexual assault\u201d.",
