      "bodyText": "Footage has been released of cracks found inside a reactor at a nuclear plant in Scotland. The unit at Hunterston B in North Ayrshire has not been operating after the cracks were found to be growing faster than expected. In March last year a planned inspection of the graphite bricks that make up the core of reactor 3 uncovered new \u201ckeyway root cracks\u201d. EDF Energy, which owns and operates the power station, said these have now grown to an average of 2mm wide. The firm has released footage of the cracks, which was taken in 2017 and 2018. The plant\u2019s director Colin Weir told BBC Scotland: \u201cNuclear safety is our overriding priority and reactor 3 has been off for the year so that we can do further inspections. \u201cWe\u2019ve carried out one of our biggest ever inspection campaigns on reactor 3; we\u2019ve renewed our modelling, we\u2019ve done experiments and tests and we\u2019ve analysed all the data from this to produce our safety case that we will submit to the Office for Nuclear Regulation. \u201cWe have to demonstrate that the reactor will always shut down and that it will shut down in an extreme seismic event.\u201d About 370 hairline cracks have been discovered, which means there is a fracture in roughly one in 10 bricks in the reactor core. Under current rules, operations must stop if the number of cracks exceeds 350. The power station is one of seven in the UK using advanced gas-cooled (AGR) reactors switched on during the 1970s and 80s; there are 14 such reactors across the seven plants, several of which have seen their lifetimes extended into the 2020s. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2019 to clarify that advanced gas-cooled reactors total 14 in the seven UK power plants, and to correct a reference that called them \u201cadvanced gas-cooling reactors\u201d.",

More than 120 people have been taken into administrative detention and at least 200 schools, seminaries and hospitals have been seized by the government this week as part of a campaign against banned Islamist organisations. The arrests and asset seizures, the most sweeping in years, targeted Islamic schools and charities considered fronts for United Nations-blacklisted militant groups that have operated with near impunity in the country. International pressure has been mounting on Islamabad after a suicide bombing in disputed Kashmir by the Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed sparked a series of tit-for-tat airstrikes between India and its neighbour and the first dogfight between their jets in nearly 50 years. Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), a welfare organisation regarded as a fundraising organ for the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, was officially banned this week and had its headquarters in Lahore sealed. \u201cA crackdown against us is under way,\u201d said Yahya Mujahid. \u201cOur offices, schools, medical facilities and ambulances are being taken over by the government.

Many Islamic charities accused of being fronts for militant organisations also provide the only education, healthcare and emergency services available to millions of poor Pakistanis. A major earthquake in Kashmir in 2005 and a national flood crisis in 2010 opened a fresh opportunity for Islamic charities such as JuD to demonstrate they could provide the relief services that the government could not \u2013 services that helped them to lure new recruits to banned militant groups. With public education in shambles, Pakistan\u2019s poorest families often turn to Islamic schools that feed and house their children but also push a more militant brand of Islam on them.
