Asked to follow on, they had a stinker of a start at nought for one, but Tom Westley and Alastair Cook smoothed the waters with a partnership of 157. </p> <p>The teams shook hands after Westley was out for 97. The draw confirms that Warwickshire survive to play another Division One summer and sends winless Nottinghamshire down. Essex, eights points behind leaders Somerset, entertain Surrey at Chelmsford next week and go to Taunton for the final round.</p> <p>The Division Two championship race heated up after <strong>Sussex</strong> beat <strong>Gloucestershire </strong>in Bristol by eight wickets. Gloucestershire cobbled together 46 for their last four wickets but Sussex easily knocked off the 74 needed, after Phil Salt and Stiaan van Zyl put on an unbroken 41 for the third wicket. Sussex have refound their mojo just in time \u2013 and lie fifth in the table \u2013 in with a glimmer of a chance if they win both their remaining matches. Gloucestershire slip down to third. </p> <p>After the match, the Sussex coach, Jason Gillespie, said he had been on the phone to the England coach, Trevor Bayliss. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Trevor Bayliss if we can have Jofra Archer back for the last game, but the answer was no. That\u2019s fair enough. We had a bit of a joke about it. We\u2019ve decided not to bring in another overseas players for the last few games, like some of the other counties have done. We\u2019ll go with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Northamptonshire</strong> easily beat bottom-of-the-table <strong>Leicestershire </strong>to secure second place in the table after Ben Curran and Alex Wakely made forties to ensure victory. \u201cMomentum is huge, we\u2019re playing with a lot of confidence,\u201d said Wakely afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s in our hands now, next week against Durham is a massive game.

      "bodyText": "Essex\u2019s championship charge stumbled as they were forced to spend the last day at Edgbaston batting to save the match. They were dismissed for 324 in the morning, also falling short of a crucial third batting point, with Warwickshire\u2019s captain Jeetan Patel pocketing six for 73. Asked to follow on, they had a stinker of a start at nought for one, but Tom Westley and Alastair Cook smoothed the waters with a partnership of 157. The teams shook hands after Westley was out for 97. The draw confirms that Warwickshire survive to play another Division One summer and sends winless Nottinghamshire down. Essex, eights points behind leaders Somerset, entertain Surrey at Chelmsford next week and go to Taunton for the final round. The Division Two championship race heated up after Sussex beat Gloucestershire in Bristol by eight wickets. Gloucestershire cobbled together 46 for their last four wickets but Sussex easily knocked off the 74 needed, after Phil Salt and Stiaan van Zyl put on an unbroken 41 for the third wicket. Sussex have refound their mojo just in time \u2013 and lie fifth in the table \u2013 in with a glimmer of a chance if they win both their remaining matches. Gloucestershire slip down to third. After the match, the Sussex coach, Jason Gillespie, said he had been on the phone to the England coach, Trevor Bayliss. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Trevor Bayliss if we can have Jofra Archer back for the last game, but the answer was no. That\u2019s fair enough. We had a bit of a joke about it. We\u2019ve decided not to bring in another overseas players for the last few games, like some of the other counties have done. We\u2019ll go with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d Northamptonshire easily beat bottom-of-the-table Leicestershire to secure second place in the table after Ben Curran and Alex Wakely made forties to ensure victory. \u201cMomentum is huge, we\u2019re playing with a lot of confidence,\u201d said Wakely afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s in our hands now, next week against Durham is a massive game. We want to finish second if we possibly can.\u201d So that\u2019s it from here for today - after Lancashire confirmed their promotion to Division One yesterday, today has signed Nottinghamshire\u2019s relegation warrant - therefore saving Warwickshire\u2019s place in Division One. It\u2019s all hotting up nicely for the last two rounds - with Somerset patting the nice eight point lead in their back pocket as they head for the Ageas Bowl; and all to play for in the remaining two Division Two promotion places. Thanks for all the messages and chat below the line and sticking with CCLive! on a quiet day. See you next week - good night! Win-less with only two rounds to go, Nottinghamshire are relegated to Division Two after a disastrous Championship campaign in which they have totted up only 11 batting points. They shake hands at Edgbaston after Tom Westley falls for 97 - giving him 237 runs in the match. Essex never recovered from their decision to bowl first - and now slip eight points behind Somerset in the championship race with just two games to go. WARWICKSHIRE RETAIN FIRST DIVISION STATUS FOR NEXT YEAR Good to see Jason Gillespie trying his hand for the last match of the season: \u201cI\u2019ve asked Trevor Bayliss if we can have Jofra Archer back for the last game, but the answer was no. That\u2019s fair enough, it was what I expected. We had a bit of a joke about it one the phone. We\u2019ve decided not to bring in another overseas players for the last few games, like some of the other counties have done. We\u2019ll go with what we\u2019ve got.\u201d In the Wantage Road area with some free time on your hands tonight? And things are purring over smoothly at Edgbaston - just time for both Westley (87 not out) and Alastair Cook (55 not out) to reach their hundreds before handshakes. Good news for Somerset fans - Tom Banton has just signed a new two-year contract extension. I\u2019ve just got an email from Somerset asking that anyone who wants to attend the final game against Essex lets them know as they\u2019re expecting heavy demand for media seats. Sky cameras will also be there. Uneasy lies the head that nearly wears the crown. Which leaves us with one..Warwickshire v Essex which is slowly meandering towards a draw. Essex 82-1 trail Warwickshire by 111, with 48 overs left in the day. A draw is still meaningful, as it will confirm Nottinghamshire\u2019s relegation, and Warwickshire\u2019s place in Division One for 2020. Van Zyl and Salt take Sussex safely home, which bunny-hops them up to fifth. See Div 2 table below. Thank you Mes for these lovely roses - good to see you are hedging you bets in case of an impromptu CCLive! garden party. Alastair Cook and Tom Westley nice and steady steady for Essex - 57-1. Some post-match quotes from Grace Road where Alex Wakely, who has stuck with Northants through thick and thin, is feeling positive. \u201cI feel in decent touch, I\u2019m enjoying batting without the pressures of captaincy, playing with a smile on my face. But everything is easy when you\u2019re winning! \u201cThat said, momentum is huge, we\u2019re playing with a lot of confidence, the balance of the team looks good and we\u2019re in a very good position. It\u2019s in our hands now, next week against Durham is a massive game. We want to finish second if we possibly can.\u201d I haven\u2019t worked this out so I hope it doesn\u2019t spell something rude like the rogue Guardian crossword the other day, but something to pass the afternoon. A lovely apple from the tree polishes off lunch nicely. Meanwhile at Bristol, Tom Haines has gone but Sussex are nearly there on their latest of late charges. Just 24 more to win. Curran and Wakely guide Northants to victory, which takes them up to second in the Division Two table, nine points ahead of Gloucestershire, 14 points clear of Durham, and 16 clear of Glamorgan, who will be overtaken by Sussex this afternoon. Division One Warwickshire 517; Essex 324 (Westley 141; Jeetan Patel 6-73) and 26-1. Essex trail by 167 runs with 9 wickets and 66 overs remaining . Division Two Gloucestershire 200 &amp; 243; Sussex 370 and 24-1. Sussex need 50 to win. Northants have lost a couple more wickets but it\u2019s almost in the bag - just 20 more needed. And THANK YOU so much to Wegie below the line for spotting this - it seems the Darren Stevens show may have another season yet to run. \u201cWe are allowed to change our minds and we want to reward performance,\u201d Kent head coach Matt Walker told BBC Radio Kent. \u201cAt the moment Darren\u2019s performances are right up there. \u201cWe have to get the balance right - especially at Kent - between still trying to be competitive and win, but also making sure young players are progressing.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with how he batted, more than how he bowled. Those runs at that stage of the game were very important. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t batted as well as he would have liked in this format and that was vintage Darren with the bat, which was great to see. \u201cAnd with the ball he\u2019s been fantastic for the last few wickets, as he has been for however many years.\u201d Safe to say that David Warner has a bit of a shocker. Out for 0 - lbw Broad Out for 0 - c Bairstow b Broad Out for 0 - lbw Broad Out for 61 - c Bairstow b Archer Out for 5 - c Burns b Archer Out for 3 - b Broad Out for 8 - c Bairstow b Broad Out for 2 - lbw Broad Out for 5 - c Bairstow b Archer Gloucestershire all out. Sussex need 84 to win. Ah! I forgot that the follow-on in county cricket is 150. Warwickshire have in fact enforced the follow on. And calamity! Nick Browne is out to the fourth ball of the innings. Essex 0/1. Essex all out after a pig of a morning for 324. A deficit of 193. Warwickshire just need to bat out the day to be assured of Division One cricket next year, and hand Somerset a tasty lead going into the final two rounds. The irrepressible Jeetan Patel finished with 6-73. A wicket at Grace Road, Rob Newton for 29, but surely too late for any last-minute wobbles. Northants 74-1, need 67. Thinking on the New Zealand tour - which, I was reminded at Lord\u2019s yesterday, won\u2019t count for the new Test World Championship. If they rest most of the World Cup &amp; Test players and hand the captaincy to Stokes - on the assumption that he would like to go back to New Zealand -who else gets on the plane? Some names to throw in the pot - Sibley, Crawley, Azad (too soon?), Pope, Foakes, Ollie Robinson, Donald, Malan, Gregory, Bartlett? Nice to see Ben Curran getting runs in what hasn\u2019t quite been the breakthrough season he was hoping for - only one fifty in nine innings to date. When men were men, and phones were MASSIVE. Essex having a Friday wobble, two wickets gone in the first half hour. Gloucestershire are having one of those mornings, the eighth wicket goes with the lead only 35. Sussex, who were jeered at by a rather pathetic bunch of home fans before the summer break, could be about to pull the rabbit out of the hat. On his fiftieth birthday, Shane Warne makes one of his most important contributions to cricket, speaking out on the climate crisis. A wicket with the fourth ball of the day for Chris Jordan down at Bristol, Jack Taylor for ten. Gloucestershire\u2019s lead is just 30. Follow all the latest at the Test with our crack team of OBOers. We could pass the time BTL on what will be a quietish day by chewing on our pencils to come up with 16s for the men\u2019s winter tour parties: New Zealand in November for five T20s and two Tests; then a mega-tour of South Africa from December to February consisting of four Tests, three ODIs and three T20s. Division One: Warwickshire 517; Essex 278-6. Essex trail by 239 runs with four wickets remaining (first innings). Division Two: Gloucestershire 200 &amp; 197-6; Sussex 370. Gloucs lead by 27 runs with four wickets remaining (second innings). Division Two: Leicestershire 308 &amp; 189; Northants 357 &amp; 22-0. Northants need 119 runs to win. Division One: Hampshire (149 &amp; 436) beat Surrey (162 &amp; 151) by 272 runs. Kent (304 &amp; 259) beat Nottinghamshire (124 &amp; 212) by 227 runs. Somerset (199 &amp; 329) beat Yorkshire (103-9 &amp; 127-9) by 298 runs. Division Two: Middlesex (143 &amp; 151) beat Durham (147 &amp; 191) by 44 runs. Lancashire (418) beat Derbyshire (244 &amp; 129) by an innings and 45 runs. Worcestershire (205 &amp; 299) beat Glamorgan (193 &amp; 156) by 155 runs. Good morning! from this final day of the-round-before-the-penultimate-round of the season, where just three games are still breathing. As it was ordained, the day has dawned brightly in Manchester now that Lancashire have returned to the bright lights of Division One, thanks to a thumping win over Derbyshire yesterday.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/michaelmorpurgo\">Michael Morpurgo</a> has all the trappings befitting a prolific, bestselling and beloved children\u2019s author. There is the National Theatre production (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/04/war-horse-big-hit\">War Horse</a>, still touring the globe) and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/12/war-horse-spielberg-film-review\">Spielberg movie adaptation</a>; the stint as children\u2019s laureate (a post he helped create); the gold Blue Peter badge and the knighthood. But as a vocal campaigner against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, he is getting used to rather a different kind of reception.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been spat at,\u201d Britain\u2019s storyteller-in-chief says nonchalantly over lunch at his local pub in an idyllic Devon village. \u201cI went to Sidmouth folk festival \u2013 quite a peaceable part of the world, you would have thought.\u201d The trouble began when he bought one of the \u201clittle blue badges with stars around it\u201d. Clare, Morpurgo\u2019s wife of 56 years, interjects. \u201cNo, it said, \u2018Bollocks to Brexit.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it had stars around it!\u201d Morpurgo says in mock indignation. As for the spitting: \u201cIt was horrible. I was very upset. [The man] looked at me with an unbelievable dislike. I can\u2019t think of a time in my life when that would have happened. We\u2019re almost coming to a civil war situation where there\u2019s so much hate.\u201d</p> <p>When not putting his head above the parapet with newspaper articles and an appearance in what Channel 4 News called \u201cthe most polite Brexit debate ever\u201d, Morpurgo can be found at home in bed, writing prolifically in school exercise books while propped up on a pile of pillows (inspired by his hero, Robert Louis Stevenson).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf52320b4e417cc7861ec7b281a6cd221897240d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf52320b4e417cc7861ec7b281a6cd221897240d/0_306_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019ve become a selfish people, an unkind people\u2019 \u2026 Morpurgo at home in Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ve become a selfish people, an unkind people\u2019 \u2026 Morpurgo at home in Devon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his latest book, Boy Giant, he takes on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\">refugee crisis</a> with an update of Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels. His Lilliput is one in which strangers are welcomed in and emperors have been replaced with storytellers. I tell him I found the first section \u2013 detailing 12-year-old Omar\u2019s escape from Afghanistan, alone in an over-filled, sinking rubber boat \u2013 distressing. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that,\u201d he says, unsurprised. After all, it is the adults who tend to come out of War Horse in tears.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult line to draw, but I think one must err on the side of upsetting people. The minute you make it bland and you tie a yellow ribbon around it and say, \u2018Actually it\u2019s fine\u2019 ... well, it\u2019s not. That is the reality. The rest of the book may be wishful thinking, but that\u2019s what these children are living through.\u201d Morpurgo resolved to write the book after seeing the body of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/alan-kurdi\">the three-year-old Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi</a>, washed up on a Turkish beach in September 2015.</p> <p>\u201cJust as when I wrote about the first world war, I don\u2019t want anyone to feel comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not entertainment. All literature should be, yes, life-enhancing, but troubling \u2013 at the end of the day it should be forcing you to ask questions. But I am sorry if it upsets you too much. Have another sip of beer.\u201d</p> <p>The book\u2019s Brexit and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> parallels are plain. Morpurgo\u2019s favourite part of the story is when Omar turns a stone wall separating two peoples into a bridge. At one point, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu\">Lilliput</a>\u2019s elder stateswoman declares: \u201cWe shall fish together, trade with one another, be friends again as we always were for hundreds of years \u2026 There will be no more walls, no more flags, no more tyrants.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b255c87615ae29b31222d9bd4370d1db0f7a4b87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b255c87615ae29b31222d9bd4370d1db0f7a4b87/0_1372_6495_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Invader alert \u2026 one of Michael Foreman\u2019s illustrations for Boy Giant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"406\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Invader alert \u2026 one of Michael Foreman\u2019s illustrations for Boy Giant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Michael Foreman 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In between sips of pea and ham soup, Morpurgo details his despair with the world. He ranges from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\">Grenfell Tower fire</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush</a>, to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border\">US-Mexico border</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/kashmir\">Kashmir</a>. And he speaks of his first-hand experience in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza\">Gaza</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais\">Calais refugee camp</a>. We have turned, he says, into a \u201cnot-caring society\u201d.</p> <p>He concludes that there is no use pointing the finger at the \u201csupremely arrogant\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a>. \u201cThis is our fault,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is us. We\u2019ve become a selfish people, an unkind people. I think this thing of kindness is very important. It\u2019s thought to be sort of soft and a bit liberal to be kind. Well, no, it\u2019s not. If someone is starving in the street, you feed them.\u201d</p> <p>Morpurgo believes we\u2019ve become progressively less open-hearted in the century since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/firstworldwar\">first world war</a>, when Britain took in 250,000 Belgian refugees. \u201cWe were at war at the time, our backs against the wall, and I\u2019m sure there were people who moaned about it, but the government took the decision that these people needed help.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don't know what it is like to be chased from our homes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By world war two, hearts had hardened. Apart from taking in nearly 10,000 mainly Jewish children, Britain left the rest \u201cto the tender mercies of these ghastly, ghastly tyrants and these fascists, when everyone who cared about these things knew what Hitler might do to the Jewish people.\u201d</p> <p>In the current crisis, it is believed that Britain hasn\u2019t taken in anywhere near the proposed 3,000 child refugees from Europe. Morpurgo detects an empathy gap arising from the fact that, unlike almost every other country on the continent, \u201cfor 1,000 years, we have never been invaded. We do not know what it is like to be chased from our homes.\u201d</p> <p>The 75-year-old also details his anger at the 210,000 homeless children in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/21/homeless-children-put-up-in-shipping-containers-report-says\">some living in shipping containers</a>. \u201cThere are still more than 2,000 children\u2019s homes in this country. Unwanted children, in a society that professes to love children. In my old age, I\u2019m thinking more and more about how appalling that is. And that\u2019s what Swift was on about. It\u2019s not good enough to go and pray in church and to sing All Things Bright and Beautiful. This is a cruel world \u2013 and it\u2019s got no better.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"932c64d8adfa5295747e8f87173069631b007cf7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/932c64d8adfa5295747e8f87173069631b007cf7/475_777_5424_3254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dreamed up in the pub \u2026 War Horse at the National Theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dreamed up in the pub \u2026 War Horse at the National Theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brinkhoff/Moegenburg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morpurgo\u2019s own upbringing was unconventional. While his father, actor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Van_Bridge\">Tony van Bridge</a>, was stationed in Baghdad during the war, his mother fell in love with another man, Jack Morpurgo.

      "bodyText": "Michael Morpurgo has all the trappings befitting a prolific, bestselling and beloved children\u2019s author. There is the National Theatre production (War Horse, still touring the globe) and its Spielberg movie adaptation; the stint as children\u2019s laureate (a post he helped create); the gold Blue Peter badge and the knighthood. But as a vocal campaigner against Brexit, he is getting used to rather a different kind of reception. \u201cI\u2019ve been spat at,\u201d Britain\u2019s storyteller-in-chief says nonchalantly over lunch at his local pub in an idyllic Devon village. \u201cI went to Sidmouth folk festival \u2013 quite a peaceable part of the world, you would have thought.\u201d The trouble began when he bought one of the \u201clittle blue badges with stars around it\u201d. Clare, Morpurgo\u2019s wife of 56 years, interjects. \u201cNo, it said, \u2018Bollocks to Brexit.\u2019\u201d \u201cWell, it had stars around it!\u201d Morpurgo says in mock indignation. As for the spitting: \u201cIt was horrible. I was very upset. [The man] looked at me with an unbelievable dislike. I can\u2019t think of a time in my life when that would have happened. We\u2019re almost coming to a civil war situation where there\u2019s so much hate.\u201d When not putting his head above the parapet with newspaper articles and an appearance in what Channel 4 News called \u201cthe most polite Brexit debate ever\u201d, Morpurgo can be found at home in bed, writing prolifically in school exercise books while propped up on a pile of pillows (inspired by his hero, Robert Louis Stevenson). In his latest book, Boy Giant, he takes on the refugee crisis with an update of Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels. His Lilliput is one in which strangers are welcomed in and emperors have been replaced with storytellers. I tell him I found the first section \u2013 detailing 12-year-old Omar\u2019s escape from Afghanistan, alone in an over-filled, sinking rubber boat \u2013 distressing. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that,\u201d he says, unsurprised. After all, it is the adults who tend to come out of War Horse in tears. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult line to draw, but I think one must err on the side of upsetting people. The minute you make it bland and you tie a yellow ribbon around it and say, \u2018Actually it\u2019s fine\u2019 ... well, it\u2019s not. That is the reality. The rest of the book may be wishful thinking, but that\u2019s what these children are living through.\u201d Morpurgo resolved to write the book after seeing the body of the three-year-old Syrian boy, Alan Kurdi, washed up on a Turkish beach in September 2015. \u201cJust as when I wrote about the first world war, I don\u2019t want anyone to feel comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not entertainment. All literature should be, yes, life-enhancing, but troubling \u2013 at the end of the day it should be forcing you to ask questions. But I am sorry if it upsets you too much. Have another sip of beer.\u201d The book\u2019s Brexit and Trump parallels are plain. Morpurgo\u2019s favourite part of the story is when Omar turns a stone wall separating two peoples into a bridge. At one point, Lilliput\u2019s elder stateswoman declares: \u201cWe shall fish together, trade with one another, be friends again as we always were for hundreds of years \u2026 There will be no more walls, no more flags, no more tyrants.\u201d In between sips of pea and ham soup, Morpurgo details his despair with the world. He ranges from the Grenfell Tower fire and Windrush, to the US-Mexico border and Kashmir. And he speaks of his first-hand experience in Gaza and the Calais refugee camp. We have turned, he says, into a \u201cnot-caring society\u201d. He concludes that there is no use pointing the finger at the \u201csupremely arrogant\u201d Boris Johnson. \u201cThis is our fault,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is us. We\u2019ve become a selfish people, an unkind people. I think this thing of kindness is very important. It\u2019s thought to be sort of soft and a bit liberal to be kind. Well, no, it\u2019s not. If someone is starving in the street, you feed them.\u201d Morpurgo believes we\u2019ve become progressively less open-hearted in the century since the first world war, when Britain took in 250,000 Belgian refugees. \u201cWe were at war at the time, our backs against the wall, and I\u2019m sure there were people who moaned about it, but the government took the decision that these people needed help.\u201d By world war two, hearts had hardened. Apart from taking in nearly 10,000 mainly Jewish children, Britain left the rest \u201cto the tender mercies of these ghastly, ghastly tyrants and these fascists, when everyone who cared about these things knew what Hitler might do to the Jewish people.\u201d In the current crisis, it is believed that Britain hasn\u2019t taken in anywhere near the proposed 3,000 child refugees from Europe. Morpurgo detects an empathy gap arising from the fact that, unlike almost every other country on the continent, \u201cfor 1,000 years, we have never been invaded. We do not know what it is like to be chased from our homes.\u201d The 75-year-old also details his anger at the 210,000 homeless children in the UK, some living in shipping containers. \u201cThere are still more than 2,000 children\u2019s homes in this country. Unwanted children, in a society that professes to love children. In my old age, I\u2019m thinking more and more about how appalling that is. And that\u2019s what Swift was on about. It\u2019s not good enough to go and pray in church and to sing All Things Bright and Beautiful. This is a cruel world \u2013 and it\u2019s got no better.\u201d Morpurgo\u2019s own upbringing was unconventional. While his father, actor Tony van Bridge, was stationed in Baghdad during the war, his mother fell in love with another man, Jack Morpurgo. Van Bridge returned to find \u201cthere was no place for him\u201d and left the new family to get on with it. Despite this, the author was made to feel \u201cquite secure\u201d and looks at the state of modern childhood with a degree of dread. \u201cI think this business of being forced to grow up too quick,\u201d he says, \u201cis causing an awful lot of mental illness and difficulties. There\u2019s so much that they\u2019re having to deal with \u2013 whether it\u2019s the shape of their bodies, or things being beamed into their iPads. [Abuse] used to be shouted across the street, and then it was gone. It wasn\u2019t written down for the rest of the world to see. By and large, the adults could protect you from the worst of what was out there.\u201d Morpurgo, who failed his 11-plus and scraped a third-class degree, ended up at Sandhurst military academy, fuelled by praise for his \u201cleadership qualities\u201d, his \u201csimplistic ideas of duty\u201d and his love of a uniform. After marrying Clare at 19 \u2013 she is the daughter of Penguin books founder Allen Lane who sent his son-in-law\u2019s handwriting to a graphologist, in the hope of proving he was a gold-digger \u2013 Morpurgo decided he believed in peace more than war and began teaching. A frequent critic of the education policies of successive governments, he says if he were education secretary he would have children start formal learning at seven, eradicate exam pressure and have universal state education for all; private schools, he says, could be turned into specialist sixth-form colleges. It was in front of the fire in the pub in which we\u2019re sitting that Morpurgo dreamed up War Horse, after a conversation with a veteran of the trenches. \u201cWhen I wrote the book, Clare loved it immediately,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd she\u2019s never said anything was better, which is slightly annoying.\u201d However, it was three decades after publication before Hollywood made miraculous horse Joey world famous.

In 1982, War Horse failed to win the Whitbread prize for which it was nominated, with chairman of the judges Roald Dahl advising Morpurgo: \u201cIt\u2019s a good book, but children don\u2019t like history.\u201d His neighbour, the poet Ted Hughes, took his crestfallen friend out for a consolatory tea in the Devon town of Bideford. \u201cWinning is just as damaging to you as losing,\u201d Hughes told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve written a fine book and you\u2019ll write a finer one.\u201d Does Morpurgo think he has? He winces, then smiles. \u201cEvery time.\u201d \u2022 Boy Giant: Son of Gulliver by Michael Morpurgo is published by HarperCollins on 19 September.",
