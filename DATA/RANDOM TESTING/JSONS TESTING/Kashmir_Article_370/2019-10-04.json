      "bodyText": "The former Tory MP Rory Stewart has announced he will run for the London mayoralty as an independent candidate, after resigning from the Conservative party and standing down from his Penrith and The Border seat at the next election. The former secretary of state for international development surprised political circles and his Cumbrian constituents with the announcement, made just three months after his bid to become leader of the Conservatives. Last month he was kicked out of the parliamentary Tory party alongside 20 other rebels for voting against the government and in favour of the Benn act which blocks a no-deal Brexit and obliging the prime minister to request an extension to article 50. Stewart\u2019s announcement came just six days after he tweeted that his only priority in politics was avoiding a no-deal Brexit, and that \u201cthe only thing I am launching next week is my four-year-old\u2019s model boat\u201d. Stewart, who campaigned for remain in the 2016 referendum, had also previously had to deny that he would defect to the Liberal Democrats amid significant speculation over how he might approach another general election after being barred from running as a Tory. In an open letter to Londoners, published in the Evening Standard, Stewart wrote that he was running for mayor to try and eradicate \u201cthe suffocating embrace of our dying party politics\u201d. He said political leaders had \u201cretreated to a madhouse of mutual insults in the Gothic shouting chamber of Westminster, pitting one group against another \u2013 rich against poor, London against the rest, Brexit against remain \u2013 and all the time getting further and further away from compromise, practical solutions, and the centre ground. \u201cAnd this is why I\u2019ve decided to stand, not for a party, but as an independent.\u201d Colleagues said his departure could be a huge loss to politics in Westminster. Amber Rudd, the former works and pensions secretary who has also quit the Tories, described him as \u201cprincipled\u201d. Former Tory minister Sam Gyimah, who has joined the Lib Dems, said Stewart\u2019s departure showed there was no longer a place for moderate one-nation Conservatives within Tory ranks. The 46-year-old Eton and Oxford educated Scot served as deputy governor of two provinces in Iraq following the 2003 invasion, and is well known for walking across Afghanistan, documented in his best-selling book The Places in Between. In government he served as a minister for Defra with responsibility for flood response, a foreign office minister and prisons minister before being promoted to secretary of state for international development. His approach to the Conservative leadership contest, which involved walking the length and breadth of the country to meet the public, taking awkward selfies and using the hashtag #RoryWalks, electrified the early weeks of the campaign. However, he was knocked out in the third round. Stewart drew praise for shaking up the party\u2019s image and broadening its appeal to non-Tory voters. Among his media-friendly moves was holding a campaign event in a circus tent. He chose the Royal Albert Hall in London to effectively announce his departure as a Cumbrian MP at an event where famous letters are read to an audience. Coming on stage to read a letter from Eton about the then-schoolboy Boris Johnson, sent to his father, Stanley, Stewart told the audience of thousands: \u201cThis letter constitutes my resignation from the Conservative party.\u201d While it was not immediately clear whether his comments should be taken seriously, on Friday morning he tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s been a great privilege to serve Penrith and The Border for the last 10 years, so it is with sadness that I am announcing that I will be standing down at the next election, and that I have also resigned from the Conservative party.\u201d He timed his announcement to fit in with the print deadline for his local paper, the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald, based in Penrith, writing how \u201cso much of what I love about Britain lies in Cumbria\u201d. Just 14 minutes after his 10.30am announcement with his local paper, Stewart revealed his intention to run as mayor of London, leaving local reporters scrambling before their deadline. Images on his website were swiftly changed from fields of animals to the London skyline. Some local Conservatives and constituents were said to be disappointed at his move but understood his decision, with many paying tribute to Stewart\u2019s service to the constituency, understanding of the farming community, leading a campaign for rural broadband and his work in the aftermath of Storm Desmond. Stewart had hinted that some in his local association did not want him to run again in the next election, expected to be held this autumn. The fformer Lib Dem leader Tim Farron, whose constituency Westmorland and Lonsdale abuts Stewart\u2019s, said: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised really but I am very sad for him \u2026 I don\u2019t agree with him on a few things but he is very dedicated to public service and he just feels that the future of the party that he has been in doesn\u2019t provide a home for him. \u201cI think there was a reasonable chance he could have won Penrith and The Border \u2013 he was a very respected local MP.

      "bodyText": "The UK government has promised a court that Boris Johnson will send a letter to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 as required by the Benn act. The undertaking appears to contradict the prime minister\u2019s statements on the UK leaving the EU on 31 October regardless and unattributed claims from Downing Street that he will find a way to sidestep the act. The pledge has been given in legal papers submitted to the court of session in Edinburgh after anti-Brexit campaigners began legal action to force Johnson to uphold the act\u2019s requirements. The European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act states that if Westminster does not agree to a Brexit deal by 19 October, the prime minister has to write to the EU seeking an extension to article 50 until 31 January. The UK government has refused to release copies of its submissions in this case to the media despite repeated requests by the Guardian, the BBC and other news organisation. Key excerpts of its pledge were read out instead by Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the lawyer for the green energy millionaire Dale Vince, the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC, and the lawyer and anti-Brexit campaigner Jolyon Maugham QC. Maugham then tweeted extracts of the document. It states the prime minister accepts \u201che is subject to the public law principle that he cannot frustrate its purpose or the purpose of its provisions. Thus he cannot act so as to prevent the letter requesting the specified extension in the act from being sent.\u201d O\u2019Neill told Lord Pentland, the judge hearing the case, that Johnson had repeatedly contradicted that position, including in the Commons on Wednesday, by insisting the UK would leave on 31 October come what may. As a result, O\u2019Neill said, the court still needed to issue legally binding orders to force Johnson to comply with the Benn act in an interdict, or injunction. If the prime minister refused to do so, O\u2019Neill could return to court to ask for Johnson to be fined or jailed, he added. No 10 declined to comment. Johnson has insisted repeatedly that he will \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by 31 October. In his party conference speech on Wednesday, he said: \u201cWhat leavers want, what remainers want, what the whole world wants is to be calmly and sensibly done with the subject, and to move on: and that is why we are coming out of the EU on 31 October, come what may\u201d. As he laid out his Brexit proposals to MPs on Thursday, he told them: \u201cWe will be leaving on 31 October, deal or no deal.\u201d However, some cabinet ministers in Manchester repeatedly hinted that Downing Street believes it can circumvent the Benn act in some way, so that Brexit would still go ahead on deadline. Steve Baker, chair of the European Research Group, appeared to suggest on Friday that he had been reassured the government still intended to leave on 31 October, come what may. \u201cAll this means is that government will obey the law,\u201d he wrote. The UK government\u2019s lawyer, Andrew Webster QC, argued that no order by the courts was necessary because the prime minister had already issued a clear undertaking to the court he would obey the Benn act\u2019s provisions. Claiming it would undermine the government\u2019s negotiations with the EU to have its hands bound by the courts, Webster said: \u201cWhat we have here is a clear statement made on behalf of the prime minister and on behalf of the government as to what he will do in respect of the requirements of the 2019 act. They have been put on record so they that there can be no doubt. [The] prime minister will comply with the law.\u201d But O\u2019Neill quoted statements from a Downing Street source in a BBC story which O\u2019Neill said directly contradicted Webster\u2019s promises and proved why an interdict \u2013 an injunction to prevent to prevent Johnson breaching the Benn act \u2013 was needed. The BBC source said the Benn act\u2019s \u201cvery specific narrow duty\u201d did not prevent the government from \u201cother communications, private and public\u201d which, O\u2019Neill said, would thwart the act\u2019s duties to seek an extension to article 50 after 19 October. The BBC source said \u201cthe government is making its true position on delay known privately in Europe and this will become public soon.\u201d O\u2019Neill told the court this was proof of the government\u2019s \u201cspin, misunderstanding and misinterpretation\u201d of the act. It was proof, he said, it could not be trusted to honour what the court had been told. Lord Pentland, the judge, said it was entirely legitimate for people to question or distrust promises from public bodies. \u201cThe negotiations are one thing. Compliance with the law is another,\u201d he told Webster. \u201cPublic authorities often give undertakings to satisfy a whole host of challenges.\u201d Pentland is due to give his ruling on the interdict application on Monday, before a parallel case is heard on Tuesday where the same group of anti-Brexit campaigners will ask other judges to use powers unique to the Scottish courts to send the Benn act letter on Johnson\u2019s behalf if he refuses to do so.",

Until now. Here are the pressing topics, only some of which are worth laughing about.</p> <h2><strong>Is Joker actually a comic book movie?</strong></h2> <p>Todd Phillips, who is as crafty with the press as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Terrific_(Michael_Holt)\">Mr Terrific</a> is with T-Spheres, <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/joker-director-todd-phillips-rebuffs-criticism-of-dark-tone-we-didnt-make-the-movie-to-push-buttons-exclusive/\">has said</a> that he convinced Phoenix to appear in his supervillain origin story by suggesting they would \u201csneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic-book film\u201d. This does not sound like someone who is particularly enamoured of the genre. \u201cLet\u2019s make a real movie with a real budget and call it fucking Joker,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/joker-director-todd-phillips-rebuffs-criticism-of-dark-tone-we-didnt-make-the-movie-to-push-buttons-exclusive/\">he continued</a>. He\u2019s cited movies by <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/robert-de-niro-joker-king-of-comedy-1202055636/\">Martin Scorsese</a> and (surprisingly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lNLANDEMPlRE/status/1173686506352971776\">Chantal Akerman</a> as influences. So the question is: is this movie <em>really</em> that different?</p> <p>We\u2019ll give Philips the points here. This is lightyears away from zippy, agreeable fare like, say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/02/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review-buzzing-micro-caper-with-a-sting-in-its-tail\">Ant-Man and the Wasp</a> or Thor: Ragnarok.

While Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck <em>does</em> paint his face, and eventually masks do come into play, there are no costumes and certainly no stylised slugfests. This is a dark and (eventually) gruesomely violent drama that is nihilistic and performance-driven. It isn\u2019t about special effects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/31/joker-review-twisted-tour-de-force-joaquin-phoenix\">Joker review \u2013 Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s villain has last laugh in twisted tale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Comic book enthusiasts will still, however, find a few examples of their beloved DC lore.
