      "bodyText": "British Airways was facing passenger anger on Wednesday as more than 500 flights were cancelled or delayed as a result of a systems failure. In the latest in a series of operational problems to hit the airline, and the travel plans of tens of thousands with holiday and business plans, London\u2019s Heathrow, Gatwick and City were the airports most affected by the computer failure. BA refused to reveal the number of flights affected but according to Flightstats.com, which tracks arrivals and departures, by 5.30pm the airline had cancelled 140 flights and a further 370 had been delayed. BA said its latest systems failures affected only the London airports, but the disruption had knock-on effects elsewhere, including at Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast and in many European destinations when incoming flights failed to arrive. Customers experienced difficulties checking in online, and queues formed in airport departure areas as the airline moved to manual systems to keep flights operating. Some social media users reported that, on flights that did take off, the food and drink service was affected. Air travel experts said BA may be liable to pay compensation to affected passengers, on top of refunding them the ticket price. Under EU law, some passengers whose flights are cancelled or delayed by two hours or more can be given compensation. The airline said it was offering customers the chance to move bookings to another travel day between 8 and 13 August. About half of the BA flights scheduled to depart from Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 5 between 9.30am and midday were cancelled or delayed, according to the airport\u2019s website. It was not until 4pm that BA said it had resolved its computer problems. In a statement, the airline said: \u201cWe apologise to all our customers caught up in the disruption, and appreciate how frustrating their experience has been. Our teams have been working tirelessly to get the vast majority of customers on their way, with most of our flights departing.\u201d It added: \u201cOur flights are returning to normal. However, there may be some knock-on operational disruption.\u201d The airline was still advising passengers to check for flight information on its website before travelling to the airport. The computer failure is the latest in a series of operational problems to hit the airline in the busy holiday season. Earlier this week, BA flights were among a total of 177 flights cancelled and then reinstated because of threatened industrial action by Heathrow staff. The strikes, originally due to be begin at midnight on Monday, were suspended to allow for further talks between union and airport officials. BA also faces separate strike action from its pilots later this month. In a ballot of the pilots\u2019 union Balpa, 93% of the airline\u2019s 4,000 pilots voted in favour of taking industrial action after rejecting a three-year pay deal. BA lost a legal challenge to the strikes, which are expected to cost the airline \u00a340m a day. If BA pilots go ahead with strikes, the likely disruption could coincide with five days of walkouts announced late on Wednesday by Ryanair pilots who are members of the Balpa union. Balpa said that \u201cdecades of Ryanair refusing to deal with unions\u201d had led to members voting for a 48-hour strike beginning on 22 August and a 72-hour strike from 2 September. \u201cNo pilot wants to spoil the public\u2019s travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice,\u201d said Balpa\u2019s general secretary, Brian Strutton. A third strike action, by Heathrow ground staff, could still go ahead on 22 and 23 August unless talks result in a compromise. BA had other problems this week after 200 people had to be evacuated from a British Airways flight after smoke poured into the cabin minutes before it was due to land in Valencia. The crew used oxygen masks as they helped passengers on to the evacuation chutes. BA has previously been hit by severe computer system failures that have left passengers stranded around the world. In 2017, over a May bank holiday weekend, 75,000 passengers were stranded when the airline was forced to cancel more than 700 flights over three days.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism.

It may no longer be sufficient for parliament to tinker around the edges with Brexit. Because the no-deal trajectory is both real and unthinkable, politicians may finally decide it is time to challenge key orthodoxies. Brexit, in its current form, is not the will of the people \u2013 and it can be stopped. The outright revocation of article 50 is looking more likely, and more justified, than ever.</p> <p>Revocation has, understandably, been considered Brexit\u2019s nuclear button.

But it may prove the only way to stop the catastrophe of no deal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Revocation is the only option now because there is no time for a referendum before we crash out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If it is clear at the start of September that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/05/no-deal-brexit-is-boris-johnsons-central-scenario-eu-told\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson won\u2019t budge</a> on his impossible negotiation demands, and that the EU won\u2019t negotiate, we will be rapidly heading for no deal. MPs will then have three realistic options. The first is to enact new legislation forcing Johnson to request a new extension to the process. He has insisted that he will not do so, and the government will do all it can to hinder such legislation. A man who is showing himself uniquely contemptuous of parliament may also refuse to obey it. Even if he does, he will go to Brussels and report that he is being forced to seek an extension that the British government does not support. How is the EU supposed to respond in those circumstances? And if it does grant the extension, how can parliament ensure that Johnson accepts it?</p> <p>MPs could also bring a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. Johnson has, once again, signalled that he is indifferent to such an expression of parliamentary sovereignty. His chief of staff Dominic Cummings has indicated that, in any case, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/07/dominic-cummings-takes-swipe-at-greive-over-confidence-vote-plan\" title=\"\">prime minister would not resign</a>, and could call an election for after 31 October \u2013 effectively neutering any opposition to no deal. A court case would almost certainly follow, but the process would be messy and chaotic.</p> <p>And so the only guaranteed way to stop no deal is to stop Brexit itself. Faced with an unprecedented national emergency, MPs could pass an act of parliament revoking article 50. This would satisfy our \u201cconstitutional requirements\u201d specified by the European court when it granted the UK the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/04/britain-legally-cancel-brexit-eu-parliament-court-remain\" title=\"\">unilateral right to revoke</a>. It could also be done without government support, as with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/08/theresa-may-forced-to-delay-brexit-after-historic-win-for-mps\" title=\"\">Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill in April</a> to force an extension. That passed in three days, while this bill would have more than six weeks.</p> <p>For Tories, in particular, this would carry the advantage of not directly forcing them to bring down their own government. Moderate Conservatives did not sign up to Brexit at any cost and owe Johnson no personal loyalty, while leave-sympathetic Labour MPs <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-48843758/brexit-revoking-article-50-better-than-no-deal-says-labour-s-lisa-nandy\" title=\"\">such as Lisa Nandy</a> have signalled they would also back such a move. Even if there was no time to clear the bill before 31 October, the EU might take note of the clearly expressed will of parliament to remain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/06/no-deal-brexit-boris-johnson-bluff-consequences-real\">No deal may be a Boris Johnson bluff, but the consequences will be real | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Certainly there would be a question of democratic legitimacy. Brexit was enacted by a referendum and should be ended by one too. Parliament could therefore legislate for a subsequent confirmatory plebiscite to establish whether people in fact want to stay in, or otherwise restart the process. MPs could conceivably (though at great risk) put no deal on the ballot paper for the first time. Revocation is the only option now because there is no time for a referendum before we crash out.</p> <p>The Britain of 2019 is unrecognisable from the country of four years ago. A Brexit that in 2015 meant a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/28/the-norway-option-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-britain\" title=\"\">Norway-style single market</a> has come to entail our total rupture with every EU instrument, body and law, at any political, economic and human cost. Since the referendum, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/25/power-brexit-boris-johnson-radical-conservative-party\" title=\"\">Brexiters</a> have refused all compromise. The hardline fringes have hijacked a slim mandate and reinterpreted it in the most extreme way available to them. No deal is the all-or-nothing corruption of a democratic vote, and revocation is its democratic answer. Like every other outcome, it will provoke a sustained political crisis. But in the end it may be the only way to save the economy \u2013 and people\u2019s lives.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence</p>",

      "bodyText": "A run on the pound was once the kind of event that troubled a prime minister. If it was shown to be the direct result of a policy the prime minister refused to change, it might even have unseated them. No longer. Now a Conservative government\u2019s central policy will not just crash the pound, but also end Britain\u2019s manufacturing and agriculture overnight and block half the country\u2019s transportation of food and medicines \u2013 and it shows no shame whatsoever. Extraordinary and radical times demand a similar response. It may no longer be sufficient for parliament to tinker around the edges with Brexit. Because the no-deal trajectory is both real and unthinkable, politicians may finally decide it is time to challenge key orthodoxies. Brexit, in its current form, is not the will of the people \u2013 and it can be stopped. The outright revocation of article 50 is looking more likely, and more justified, than ever. Revocation has, understandably, been considered Brexit\u2019s nuclear button. Remainers in parliament have been unwilling to vote for it or even discuss it. But it may prove the only way to stop the catastrophe of no deal. If it is clear at the start of September that Boris Johnson won\u2019t budge on his impossible negotiation demands, and that the EU won\u2019t negotiate, we will be rapidly heading for no deal. MPs will then have three realistic options. The first is to enact new legislation forcing Johnson to request a new extension to the process. He has insisted that he will not do so, and the government will do all it can to hinder such legislation. A man who is showing himself uniquely contemptuous of parliament may also refuse to obey it. Even if he does, he will go to Brussels and report that he is being forced to seek an extension that the British government does not support. How is the EU supposed to respond in those circumstances? And if it does grant the extension, how can parliament ensure that Johnson accepts it? MPs could also bring a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. Johnson has, once again, signalled that he is indifferent to such an expression of parliamentary sovereignty. His chief of staff Dominic Cummings has indicated that, in any case, the prime minister would not resign, and could call an election for after 31 October \u2013 effectively neutering any opposition to no deal. A court case would almost certainly follow, but the process would be messy and chaotic. And so the only guaranteed way to stop no deal is to stop Brexit itself. Faced with an unprecedented national emergency, MPs could pass an act of parliament revoking article 50. This would satisfy our \u201cconstitutional requirements\u201d specified by the European court when it granted the UK the unilateral right to revoke. It could also be done without government support, as with Yvette Cooper\u2019s bill in April to force an extension. That passed in three days, while this bill would have more than six weeks. For Tories, in particular, this would carry the advantage of not directly forcing them to bring down their own government. Moderate Conservatives did not sign up to Brexit at any cost and owe Johnson no personal loyalty, while leave-sympathetic Labour MPs such as Lisa Nandy have signalled they would also back such a move. Even if there was no time to clear the bill before 31 October, the EU might take note of the clearly expressed will of parliament to remain. Certainly there would be a question of democratic legitimacy. Brexit was enacted by a referendum and should be ended by one too. Parliament could therefore legislate for a subsequent confirmatory plebiscite to establish whether people in fact want to stay in, or otherwise restart the process. MPs could conceivably (though at great risk) put no deal on the ballot paper for the first time. Revocation is the only option now because there is no time for a referendum before we crash out. The Britain of 2019 is unrecognisable from the country of four years ago. A Brexit that in 2015 meant a Norway-style single market has come to entail our total rupture with every EU instrument, body and law, at any political, economic and human cost. Since the referendum, the Brexiters have refused all compromise. The hardline fringes have hijacked a slim mandate and reinterpreted it in the most extreme way available to them. No deal is the all-or-nothing corruption of a democratic vote, and revocation is its democratic answer. Like every other outcome, it will provoke a sustained political crisis. But in the end it may be the only way to save the economy \u2013 and people\u2019s lives. \u2022 Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence",

There are large areas of the country from which we hear very little. Potentially, there are thousands more miles that could disappear without immediate action. We urgently need more people to get involved.\u201d</p> <p>The reason for the urgency is the UK government\u2019s decision to set 1 January 2026 as a deadline for applications to change definitive maps held by local councils. These maps are supposed to show every public right of way in existence, but in practice, they do not. When the maps were drawn up in 1949, the recording process was patchy and fairly arbitrary: some parishes faithfully set down all their paths, some managed a proportion, others did almost nothing.</p> <p>Some of the omissions are shocking: drovers\u2019 roads used for centuries suddenly truncated, key access ways to historic sites or coastal features vanished. One reader found a local walk that simply ended in the middle of a wood, an orphan caused by the boundary between Herefordshire and Shropshire. \u201cIt was great fun researching the history of the footpath and I learned a huge amount,\u201d he says. The application is now lodged, and despite the frustrating pace at which local authorities are examining each case, the application will stand, beyond the 2026 deadline if necessary.</p> <p>Near St Just in Cornwall, a Guardian reader discovered a vital path connecting to the south-west coastal route. \u201cIt was almost invisible due to high ferns growing all over, but it was possible to follow the traces. It is not a long stretch and could be cleared with a brush cutter.\u201d</p> <p>In Devon a group of locals, the Brentor Commons Association, identified a lost drover\u2019s path then got a grant from the <a href=\"https://www.coop.co.uk/local-causes\" title=\"\">Co-op Local Causes</a> to fund restoration. Their centuries-old path, now named The Holloway, has become a popular local walk.</p> <p>In Leintwardine, Herefordshire, estate maps from 1780 helped Jonathan Hopkinson identify a lost way, possibly part of a Roman road. The application to change the definitive map is now under way and Hopkinson has identified two further paths that will help create a circular route.</p> <p>For Jack Cornish, a key discovery of the project has been the history behind every lost footpath. One right of way was rediscovered after an observant art-lover spotted an interesting aspect to a <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gainsborough-wooded-landscape-with-a-peasant-resting-n01283\" title=\"\">Gainsborough painting in</a><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gainsborough-wooded-landscape-with-a-peasant-resting-n01283\" title=\"\"> Tate Britain</a>. \u201cHe had worked out the spot where Gainsborough had painted the picture in 1747 and, from that, after checking old maps, had realised that the artist had been using a footpath, one subsequently lost.\u201d</p> <p>Stephen Whittle had a similar experience with an 1892 painting by Thomas Prytherch that showed an access lane down to the River Severn at Wroxeter, an ancient route and one Stephen had used as a child to go swimming, but which was now blocked by gates. Maps from the 19th century back up his claim.</p> <p>The battle for rights of way is certainly not a new one. Prof Eric Jones, an emeritus professor at Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe University and the author of Landed Estates and Rural Inequality in English History, has found many examples of losses going back to the 17th century. \u201cThe appropriation of rights of way,\u201d he writes, \u201cis a perpetual but surprisingly overlooked aspect of England\u2019s much-studied landscape.\u201d Preferences for privacy and fine views led landowners to demolish villages and reroute, or simply obliterate, roads and paths. Jones points to a typical case in Methley, West Yorkshire, when, in 1627, Sir Henry Savile built a new park and refused to countenance \u201ca common road way\u201d through it. The right of way simply disappeared.</p> <p>At some point, all of us have probably wondered why the routes of certain roads can be so capricious, suddenly darting around an apparently unnecessary right angle. The answer is often in the past. The A350 between Shaftesbury and Blandford Forum, for example, does a big loop to avoid a certain fish pond, the property in the 17th century of the Beckford family, whose sugar plantations in Jamaica paid for their Dorset estate to be remodelled, including the diversion of local roads. A contemporary trunk road, it seems, can owe its course to the slave trade.</p> <p>John Andrews, a keen walker in Suffolk, is a veteran of more recent battles. He saw the original story and got in touch to tell us he has submitted more than 800 applications since 1973. \u201cWhen I first asked my local council for their definitive map, they didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201d The map was eventually found, in an attic, and Andrews pored over it with a council officer. \u201cOur first discovery was that their new council building was built on a public footpath.\u201d</p> <p>The early years of Andrews\u2019s campaign were marred by bullying and violence. \u201cI was physically attacked several times by landowners.\u201d The old one-inch OS maps were not made for walkers and caused disputes.

His advice to those submitting applications is simple. \u201cGo through the Ramblers, they will save you no end of time and effort. And collect strong evidence.\u201d</p> <p>For Cornish, the battle for our rights of way is about what kind of country we want to live in. \u201cMore paths means people are more likely to walk. Take away a useful cut-through in a town, for example, and someone might drive to work instead of walking. More paths mean a healthier and happier population.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0813d0da40b0e0b41420512ea397140674527f8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0813d0da40b0e0b41420512ea397140674527f8a/0_440_4032_2584/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A rescued footpath in the Peak District.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A rescued footpath in the Peak District.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don't Lose Your Way</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is an argument that seems to have resonated internationally.
