      "bodyText": "India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has claimed a landslide victory in national elections that cements the Hindu nationalist leader as the country\u2019s most formidable politician in decades. Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) had been expected to easily form a governing coalition with smaller allies, but official results showed the party ahead in at least 300 seats, comfortably beyond the 272 seats required for a majority in the lower house of parliament. Its main national opponent, Congress, was leading in just 50 constituencies and its party president, Rahul Gandhi, was turfed out of his family\u2019s bastion seat of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh state. \u201cTogether we grow,\u201d Modi said on Twitter as the results came in. \u201cTogether we prosper. Together we will build a strong and inclusive India. India wins yet again!\u201d In a later televised address, he was critical of those who had doubted the BJP could increase its majority. \u201cThe political pundits of India have to leave behind their ideas of the past,\u201d he said. This year\u2019s polls, held over seven phases starting on 11 April, have been described as a contest for the soul of India. They pitted Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government against a disparate group of opposition parties including Congress, whose secular vision has defined the country for most of the past 72 years. Votes from 542 lower-house constituencies \u2013 one fewer than usual after authorities discovered \u00a31.3m in unaccounted cash in a south Indian party leader\u2019s home and cancelled the poll there \u2013 started being counted at 8am local time (3.30am GMT), and results were released progressively throughout the day. By early Thursday evening the BJP had won in close to 20 constituencies in the crucial state of West Bengal \u2013 up from just two seats in 2014 \u2013 while holding off a co-ordinated challenge from opposition parties in the Hindi heartland states of north India, where its support had been expected to fall from the high watermark of five years ago. Now it appears 2014 was no aberration, and that Indian politics has likely entered a new era of Hindu nationalist hegemony fuelled by Modi\u2019s extraordinary popularity. \u201cWe are in an era where you have, once more, a central gravitational force around which Indian politics revolves,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the south Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cI think 2019 will confirm that the BJP has replaced the Congress as that.\u201d Nationalist agenda The emphatic victory will be greeted with dismay among some members of religious minority groups, who have voiced fears that a returned BJP government would be further emboldened to prosecute its Hindu nationalist agenda, including controversial citizenship-status checks to root out unauthorised migrants in border states. The BJP\u2019s president, Amit Shah, described illegal migrants in the country\u2019s north-east as \u201ctermites\u201d in one speech that was widely condemned by opponents. Among the BJP candidates who won on Thursday was Pragya Singh Thakur, a Hindu nun and terrorism accused who is still facing trial for involvement in a 2008 bombing plot that killed six Muslims and injured scores of others. Alongside nationalism and Modi\u2019s personal magnetism, the BJP\u2019s victory was also fuelled by a relentless, data-driven and highly disciplined style of campaigning. The party sent up to 20 campaigners to manage the area around each polling booth, ensuring they knew their possible voters and what messages would resonate with them, an evolution from the older style of courting or inducing local chieftains to bring out their villages to vote. \u201cWe had organisations sitting in every booth and that\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said Rajat Sethi, a BJP strategist. Modi the master The decisions of voters in the vast country of 1.3 billion people have been driven by innumerable local concerns, caste and religion, or rumours and opinions traded over WhatsApp or cups of chai at a tea stand. But the figure of Modi has towered over the contest like no prime minister since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s. \u201cThere is no match for Modi among the opposition parties,\u201d said Rahul Verma, a fellow at the Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research. \u201cHe\u2019s running at nearly an all-time high popularity. He\u2019s charismatic, and people still repose faith in him despite not being very happy with the economic side of the government\u2019s performance.\u201d A survey released this week by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies found that nearly one-third of people who voted for the BJP did so in support of Modi, rather than the party or their local candidate. Modi\u2019s popularity had actually grown compared with 2014, when he led his party to the first majority victory in 30 years, the researchers said. The months leading to the election were bumpy for the BJP. A government survey revealed unemployment to be the highest in 45 years. Data showing that farming incomes had plummeted to their lowest point in 18 years confirmed the distress of agricultural workers, some of who had marched on Delhi carrying skulls that they said belonged to farmers who had committed suicide due to drought and mounting debt. Modi\u2019s promise on the 2014 campaign trail that \u201cgood days are coming\u201d threatened to turn into a millstone around his neck. Then a bombing in the disputed territory of Kashmir on 14 February helped to transform the contest. Rather than dent Modi\u2019s strongman image, the killing of 40 Indian paramilitaries by a Pakistan-based militant group became the stage for his response, an airstrike deeper in neighbouring territory than Indian jets had ever struck. \u201cIt really put a premium on leadership,\u201d said Vaishnav. \u201cIt spoke to the attributes that Modi often touts about himself: decisiveness, muscularity, nationalism and to a certain extent people started to see the vote not about a choice between political alternatives but a vote for the nation.\u201d Modi styled himself as \u201cchowkidar\u201d \u2013 Hindi for watchman \u2013 and made national security the dominant message of the early part of his campaign. Congress licks wounds Congress never found its footing again after the Pakistan strikes and has been outgunned by the BJP\u2019s deep pockets and disciplined party machine. Conceding defeat on Thursday evening, Gandhi declined to speculate on what had gone wrong. \u201cWhat matters is that the people of India have decided that Narendra Modi will be prime minister, and as an Indian person I respect it,\u201d he said. Gandhi will continue to serve in parliament from a second seat in Kerala state that he won handily on Thursday. A report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) found that the BJP took in more than 73% of the donations declared by India\u2019s seven largest political parties in 2017-18. The ruling party spent more than 260m rupees (\u00a32.9m) on advertisements on Facebook, YouTube, Google and Instagram, compared with 35m rupees by Congress. Many opposition leaders tried to paper over their differences to form a broad anti-Modi coalition. They said it would be enough to oust the leader, who won office with just over 30% of the national vote share five years ago. But their alliance was purely instrumental and had failed to inspire voters, Verma said. The process of counting more than 600m votes used to take up to 40 hours but the growing use of electronic voting machines since 1982 has made things considerably quicker.",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: MPs say they expect the PM to quit</h2> <p>Good morning briefers. Happy European election day. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and here are the top stories this morning.</p> <p>Theresa May faces the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/may-faces-crunch-meeting-as-support-for-brexit-deal-slips-away\">stark prospect of falling on her prime ministerial sword or being booted out of Downing Street</a> by her own party amid open cabinet revolt over her Brexit plan and widely predicted calamity for the Conservatives in today\u2019s European elections. The resignation of Andrea Leadsom from the cabinet last night topped off a day that will stand as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/theresa-may-clutches-at-final-straws-of-pretence-as-andrea-leadsom-resigns\">one of the most disastrous in her three-year stint in No 10</a>. The leader of the House said in her resignation letter that she no longer believed the PM\u2019s plan could deliver the referendum result and followed signals from other ministers that they would support the most contentious part of May\u2019s proposal: a vote for MPs on a second referendum. The European elections are likely to see the Tories wiped out by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party and many MPs believe May\u2019s own resignation will now come after she meets 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady tomorrow morning. \u201cGraham hinted that he expects her to resign. We all expect her to resign,\u201d said one. Today\u2019s papers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/23/end-of-the-road-what-the-papers-say-as-pressure-builds-on-theresa-may\">also have no doubt that it\u2019s the end of the road.</a></p> <p>Leadsom\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, hope her departure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/22/andrea-leadsoms-resignation-puts-her-in-pole-position\">will give her momentum to challenge fellow Brexiters Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab</a> for the party leadership if it becomes vacant. Penny Mordaunt, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/16/tory-leadership-contenders-whos-up-whos-down-replace-theresa-may\">are also among the likely contenders.</a></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Choose your future\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Rarely can nationwide elections have been so dreaded by both main parties. Forecasters are predicting that the Brexit party will win the biggest share of the vote in European elections today, possibly as much as 37%. The consequences for the Tory party are potentially disastrous but Labour could end up being pushed into third place behind the resurgent Liberal Democrats. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/23/european-election-predictions-uk-parties-brexit-labour-conservatives\">Dan Sabbagh crunches the numbers. </a>In an effort to boost dwindling turnout across the bloc, the European Commission has produced a video featuring new-born babies<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/23/choose-your-future-eu-raise-turnout-viral-video-european-elections\"> to encourage people across the bloc to \u201cchoose their future\u201d</a>.

The plan would need to be funded by a 2p increase in income tax but much of the cost would be partly offset by \u00a34.5bn worth of savings in the NHS. The report by the Institute for Public Policy Research argues that the NHS principle of free care at the point of need should be extended to this element of social care services in England. It has been free in Scotland since 2002.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Record ruling \u2013 </strong>A federal judge will not prevent banks from providing the financial records of Donald Trump, three of his children and the Trump Organization to Democrats investigating the US president\u2019s businesses.

Trump\u2019s lawyers are expected to appeal the decision as he continues his increasingly acrimonious fight against Congressional investigations.

A struggling economy at first threatened to undermine Modi\u2019s claims that \u201cgood days are coming\u201d. But the killing of 40 Indian paramilitaries by militants in Kashmir enabled Modi to make security, one of his strong suits, the dominant issue.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Stroke improvement \u2013 </strong>Deaths from strokes in England have halved in the past 10 years thanks to better treatment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/23/stroke-deaths-in-england-halved-in-a-decade-study-finds\">according to a study</a>. The incidence among older people has fallen because of medical interventions to control their blood pressure, such as prescribing statins.

      "bodyText": "Top story: MPs say they expect the PM to quit Good morning briefers. Happy European election day. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and here are the top stories this morning. Theresa May faces the stark prospect of falling on her prime ministerial sword or being booted out of Downing Street by her own party amid open cabinet revolt over her Brexit plan and widely predicted calamity for the Conservatives in today\u2019s European elections. The resignation of Andrea Leadsom from the cabinet last night topped off a day that will stand as one of the most disastrous in her three-year stint in No 10. The leader of the House said in her resignation letter that she no longer believed the PM\u2019s plan could deliver the referendum result and followed signals from other ministers that they would support the most contentious part of May\u2019s proposal: a vote for MPs on a second referendum. The European elections are likely to see the Tories wiped out by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party and many MPs believe May\u2019s own resignation will now come after she meets 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady tomorrow morning. \u201cGraham hinted that he expects her to resign. We all expect her to resign,\u201d said one. Today\u2019s papers also have no doubt that it\u2019s the end of the road. Leadsom\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, hope her departure will give her momentum to challenge fellow Brexiters Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab for the party leadership if it becomes vacant. Penny Mordaunt, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid are also among the likely contenders. * * * \u2018Choose your future\u2019 \u2013 Rarely can nationwide elections have been so dreaded by both main parties. Forecasters are predicting that the Brexit party will win the biggest share of the vote in European elections today, possibly as much as 37%. The consequences for the Tory party are potentially disastrous but Labour could end up being pushed into third place behind the resurgent Liberal Democrats. Dan Sabbagh crunches the numbers. In an effort to boost dwindling turnout across the bloc, the European Commission has produced a video featuring new-born babies to encourage people across the bloc to \u201cchoose their future\u201d. In eastern Europe, Shaun Walker reports on how the continent\u2019s estimated 10 million Roma are the forgotten constituents at a time when populist parties are stepping up attempts to demonise them. * * * Take care \u2013 Old people should be given free care to help them eat, wash and get dressed in order to improve their health and reduce the need for hospital stays, a thinktank has said. The plan would need to be funded by a 2p increase in income tax but much of the cost would be partly offset by \u00a34.5bn worth of savings in the NHS. The report by the Institute for Public Policy Research argues that the NHS principle of free care at the point of need should be extended to this element of social care services in England. It has been free in Scotland since 2002. * * * Record ruling \u2013 A federal judge will not prevent banks from providing the financial records of Donald Trump, three of his children and the Trump Organization to Democrats investigating the US president\u2019s businesses. Judge Edgardo Ramos ruled that Congress has the authority to demand the records, clearing the way for Deutsche Bank and Capital One to comply with subpoenas issued by two House of Representatives committees last month. Trump\u2019s lawyers are expected to appeal the decision as he continues his increasingly acrimonious fight against Congressional investigations. Earlier in the day, Trump ended a meeting with Democratic leaders after just a few minutes, saying that he will not work with them on infrastructure projects unless they stop investigating him. * * * India awaits \u2013 Early results point to landslide victory for Narendra Modi\u2019s BJP after counting started this morning in the Indian election. Although it might be a while before the definitive tallies are known \u2013 more than 600 million ballots have been cast \u2013 the charismatic prime minister seems certain to claim a second term in office for his Hindu nationalist party. A struggling economy at first threatened to undermine Modi\u2019s claims that \u201cgood days are coming\u201d. But the killing of 40 Indian paramilitaries by militants in Kashmir enabled Modi to make security, one of his strong suits, the dominant issue. * * * Stroke improvement \u2013 Deaths from strokes in England have halved in the past 10 years thanks to better treatment, according to a study. The incidence among older people has fallen because of medical interventions to control their blood pressure, such as prescribing statins. But those younger than 55 are having more strokes, probably as a result of obesity and type 2 diabetes, the study in the British Medical Journal says. Today in Focus podcast: the neo-Nazi plot to kill a Labour MP A plot to kill a Labour MP and a police officer was disrupted after an informant within the neo-Nazi group National Action blew the whistle. Robbie Mullen passed the details on to Matthew Collins of Hope Not Hate. Here, they tell their story. Also today: the columnist Aditya Chakrabortty on his unlikely collaboration with the techno group Underworld. Lunchtime read: why Jamie\u2019s Italian just wasn\u2019t street smart The widely accepted reason for the collapse of Jamie Oliver\u2019s chain of Italian restaurants appears to be that we have grown tired of eating out at homogenised venues, preferring food delivered to our home and a night in front of Netflix. But it is also part of a wider revolution in the great British palate, according to Tony Naylor, who argues that restaurant chains have become too samey and too slow to adapt to the tastes of diners. Where once they brightened the drab culinary landscape \u2013 especially outside London \u2013 we don\u2019t need them now that we can get hip to pok\u00e9, tacos or and plant-based brunch dishes via Instagram, or sample the latest street food trends at the growing number of communal food markets. Sport The Premier League\u2019s 20 clubs made record revenues of \u00a34.827bn in 2017\u201118, paying total wages of \u00a32.8bn, the Guardian\u2019s annual analysis of the clubs\u2019 most recently published annual accounts has revealed. Joe Root has revisited his responsibilities as England\u2019s one-day anchor before the World Cup after admitting he got slightly carried away during the recent ODI series victory against Pakistan. Efforts by the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, to expand the 2022 World Cup to 48 teams, which he said could help heal hostilities in the Middle East, have concluded in failure. Danny Cipriani has been named the Premiership\u2019s player of the season in further recognition of an outstanding first campaign with Gloucester which he hopes will culminate with a place in England\u2019s World Cup training squad. And Tracey Neville has an impressive hand to play at the Netball World Cup in Liverpool this summer but it will be the wildcards that will be the fascinating aspect of the squad unveiling on Thursday. Business Panasonic has become the latest technology company to boycott Huawei as the tech cold war between the US and China worsens. The Japanese manufacturer said it would stop supplying some components to Huawei, which has been made the subject of a trading ban by the Trump administration. Asia Pacific stocks fell to a four-month low on the news overnight. The FTSE100 is set to open down 0.3% this morning. Brexit continues to hammer the pound, which is buying $1.265 and \u20ac1.134. The papers The knives are out for Theresa May on today\u2019s front pages. Several papers feature a picture of an emotional May in the back of her car. The Mirror suggests May\u2019s drive back to No 10 last night was \u201ca scene reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s departure\u201d and to make sure readers draw a connection between the two events, has printed a thumbnail of its front page from that day in 1990 (headline: \u201cTears in the back seat\u201d), and has given today\u2019s paper the subtle headline: \u201cTears in the back seat 2\u201d. The Sun features the same picture, calling the PM \u201cTearesa\u201d. The Guardian features a photograph of a happier looking May, with the headline: \u201cBarricaded inside No 10, May clings on to power\u201d. The Express asks: \u201cHow much more can she take?\u201d The Telegraph says: \u201cMay besieged in No 10 as Leadsom resigns and her Cabinet revolts\u201d, the Times reports \u201cMay prepares to quit after cabinet mutiny\u201d, the FT\u2019s splash is: \u201cMay\u2019s premiership enters final days as cabinet revolts over Brexit\u201d, the i describes it as a \u201cCabinet coup: Prime Minister in hiding\u201d and the Mail says May has reached \u201cThe end of the road\u201d.
