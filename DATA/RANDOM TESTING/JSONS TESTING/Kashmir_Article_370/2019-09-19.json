Most of the focus has been on migration, but the foundation is very involved in adaptation \u2013 where the weather patterns will affect the poorest, helping them adapt,\u201d said Gates,whose foundation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/14/bill-gates-calls-fossil-fuel-divestment-a-false-solution\">has come under fire in the past for its investment </a>in fossil fuels.</p> <p>Gates has said climate activists are wasting their time lobbying investors to ditch stocks, calling it a \u201cfalse solution\u201d that did not reduce emissions.

In the case of the medical research budget, they made a substantial increase. \u201cFor example, when I called President Macron a year ago and asked him to host the Global Fund this year, I had to be frank and say I didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d get the increase [in cash] we needed to fight malaria, TB and HIV. I didn\u2019t know if Germany were going to come in with the increase we were asking for, I didn\u2019t know if we were even going to be successful in getting everyone to the table, but in fact we saw a meaningful increase in commitment. \u201cI can\u2019t predict that this polarisation is going to go away, but I do predict that the human desire to help other people is not; it\u2019s a very strong thing, and in the UK you have a powerful commitment to that. The Conservative party did preside over the aid budget going from 0.5% to 0.7% of gross national income, which was an amazing increase at a time when the budgets were tight. So while I know these things are up to the UK voters and the UK politicians, I haven\u2019t seen that consensus that its important to help the poorest come apart.\u201d Gates said that while things were getting better for people worldwide, the key issue now was inequality within countries, which would only be exacerbated by climate change. Bill and Melinda Gates will use the goalkeepers event to call for a new approach to development, targeting the poorest first, especially with healthcare, and supporting farmers to adapt to climate change. \u201cIts absolutely right that, over time, climate change will front substantial problems for developing countries. Most of the poorest in these countries are farmers, so temperature extremes, floods and droughts will affect their ability to grow food and feed their families. Most of the focus has been on migration, but the foundation is very involved in adaptation \u2013 where the weather patterns will affect the poorest, helping them adapt,\u201d said Gates,whose foundation has come under fire in the past for its investment in fossil fuels. Gates has said climate activists are wasting their time lobbying investors to ditch stocks, calling it a \u201cfalse solution\u201d that did not reduce emissions. They would do better to get behind the disruptive businesses like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, non-meat protein food companies he supports. After the Guardian spoke to Gates it was announced that a goalkeepers invitation had been extended to India\u2019s president, Narendra Modi \u2013 intended to recognise his work in bringing better sanitation to India, but deeply controversial because Modi is accused of human rights abuses in Kashmir.",
