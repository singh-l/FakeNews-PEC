The explorers were to meet and shake hands at the South Pole and the Times wanted a photo to scoop the world. They chose their best photographer for the hazardous mission, Stuart Heydinger.</p> <p>Heydinger, who has died aged 92, was a resourceful, brave, 6ft 1in-tall former paratrooper, as well as a brilliant news photographer. When he, his portable dark room and a priceless prototype photograph-transmitting machine arrived in New Zealand, word reached him that the thin summer polar ice at McMurdo Sound in Antarctica could not support the usual wheeled aircraft.</p> <p>Back in London, the Times panicked, ordering Heydinger to parachute into the snowy wastes, then cancelling that far-fetched notion. Instead, a US navy Neptune aircraft equipped with skis and 16 additional booster jets strapped to its fuselage blasted Heydinger to McMurdo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cfaafe78ee9200ea7c562f6f24716f941a0203f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfaafe78ee9200ea7c562f6f24716f941a0203f9/39_9_843_1163/725.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Heydinger with his trusty Rollieflex about to get aboard the US navy type P2V Neptune aircraft in Christchurch, New Zealand, for a flight to McMurdo Sound in Antarctica.\" width=\"725\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stuart Heydinger with his trusty Rollieflex about to get aboard the US navy type P2V Neptune aircraft in Christchurch, New Zealand, for a flight to McMurdo Sound in Antarctica.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the hair-raising landing, the US commander on the ground, Admiral George Dufek, asked: \u201cWhy are you not afraid to die?\u201d Heydinger replied: \u201cI would rather that than go back to London without a picture.\u201d He meant it and, to get the upper hand on the rival photographers there, he surreptitiously set up his transmitter two miles away before heading to the South Pole.</p> <p>On 19 January 1958, Fuchs and Hillary met and hurriedly shook hands. Heydinger got the shot and, while others were celebrating the historic achievement, he developed his film and made prints. He went back to his transmitter and sent three images to London.
