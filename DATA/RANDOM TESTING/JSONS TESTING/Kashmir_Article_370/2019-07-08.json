      "body": "<p>For many viewers emerging from the cinema, the first question about Midsommar will undoubtedly be: what the hell just happened? We begin our journey in the relative certainties of the real world \u2013 albeit one soured by bereavement for our heroine Dani (Florence Pugh). Nearly two-and-a-half hours later, reality has been warped to the extent that it makes perfect sense to watch Dani, drugged up and dressed as a Jeff Koons puppy, saying goodbye to her asshole boyfriend as he burns to death inside a disembowelled bear, along with other sacrificial victims, in a giant triangular barn, in the middle of Swedish nowhere, surrounded by her cheery new \u201cfamily\u201d. This is fine!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/horror-director-ari-aster-hereditary-midsommar-terrors\">Midsommar director Ari Aster: 'I often cling to dead things'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More questions arise once a sense of normality has returned. Is it a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/midsommar-review-ari-aster-florence-pugh\">horror masterpiece</a> for you, as for many critics? After this and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/01/hereditary-review-horror-toni-collette-brilliant-fear\">Hereditary</a>, does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/horror-director-ari-aster-hereditary-midsommar-terrors\">director Ari Aster</a> deserve to be crowned our new king of horror? Or if not, why not? Either way, as with Hereditary, Midsommar feels like a highly considered piece of storytelling beneath the craziness \u2013 technically precise, meticulously designed, dense with allusions, clues, references and riddles. So let\u2019s see if we can decipher some of them, process our feelings and collectively repair our frayed nerves.</p> <h2>Old-time religion?</h2> <p>The belief system of the happy inhabitants of Ha\u030arga seems to be a mix of northern European paganism, occult tradition, arcane numerology and made-up nonsense. How much of each? Native Swedes will have a better idea when it comes to the local lore. May Queens, maypoles and flower crowns are familiar elements of many real-life midsummer rituals. The runes scattered throughout the movie are also genuine (any translators of Elder Futhark out there?). Even the worse-than-death fate of Simon in the chicken coop is based on legends of a gory Norse practice known as the \u201cblood eagle\u201d. There also seems to be something significant about multiples of nine: the division of human life into four 18-year \u201cseasons\u201d, ending at 72 (that unforgettably gory cliff-jumping \u00c4ttestupa ritual is also a real thing). Note how Dani is celebrating her birthday \u2013 if it\u2019s her 27th, it would place her in the exact centre of the second season, the \u201cmidsummer\u201d of her life. Then there are the nine sacrifices, the nine-day festival, the 90-year cycle. Does it all fit together? Does it matter?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"257307c0ab5db4d6c3d8f034f7098365d072042c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/257307c0ab5db4d6c3d8f034f7098365d072042c/0_0_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Is Ari Aster the new king of horror? ...

And, as usual, Florence Pugh is just brilliant as Dani. She\u2019s so adept at registering the emotions of her character, whether they\u2019re just below the surface or breaking out into wailing hysteria. We\u2019re with her every step of the way, and, whatever else it represents, the ending of the film is satisfyingly cathartic for Dani on a personal level. As for her three male companions, they get what they deserve, don\u2019t they? They represent different facets of masculine inadequacy. It\u2019s clear that boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) is a coward and a selfish asshole from the outset, even if Dani is too fragile to realise it. Horndog Mark (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/25/will-poulter-the-little-stranger-white-straight-middle-class-male\">Will Poulter</a>) thinks he\u2019s in Sweden\u2019s answer to Love Island, and Josh (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/06/william-jackson-harper-on-midsommar-and-the-good-place\">William Jackson Harper</a>) puts morality aside in favour of academic ambition. Do these male characters represent corrupting, toxic masculinity? Or is this a parable of snarky, city-smart, modern rationalism undone by primal rural values? Or are the villagers\u2019 ancient pagan traditions actually far-right beliefs dressed up in folksy costumes? White nationalism, racial purity, eugenics, incest \u2013 something rotten at the heart of western civilisation?</p> <h2>Count the precedents</h2> <p>So many movies feed into Midsommar. It is possibly more instructive to detail differences than similarities between Midsommar and definitive folk horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wicker-man\">The Wicker Man</a>. Aster himself compared his film to Albert Brooks\u2019 1981 breakup movie Modern Romance (no, I haven\u2019t seen it either). The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/05/dont-look-now-review-roeg-horror-julie-christie-donald-sutherland\">likened Midsommar to Nicolas Roeg\u2019s Don\u2019t Look Now</a> in its treatment of grief and presentiment. Then again, is Midsommar essentially the same story as Hereditary? In both movies, a grief-stricken woman with mental health issues finds herself a pawn in the grand scheme of some sinister, ancient clan dedicated to perpetuating itself at all costs. And arrives at a place of calm acceptance. Aster made another intriguing comparison last year when he described Midsommar as a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/ari-aster-new-a24-movie-midsommar.html\">\u201cWizard of Oz for perverts\u201d</a>. Is there something in that? Dani would be Dorothy, obviously. Her male companions could well be analogues of the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man. Both stories feature storms, witchcraft and hallucinogenic plants. Dani and co even walk into H\u00e5rga down a path strewn with yellow flowers \u2013 a yellow brick road? Does that make Pelle the wizard? In retrospect, he\u2019s the one pulling the strings, isn\u2019t he?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/midsommar-review-ari-aster-florence-pugh\">Midsommar review \u2013 outrageous black-comic carnival of agony | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Is it supposed to be funny?</h2> <p>Some have complained that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/06/midsommar-review-florence-pugh-ari-aster-horror-hereditary\">Midsommar\u2019s horror is undercut by its over-the-top ridiculousness</a>, and therefore it\u2019s not as scary as it is trying to be.
