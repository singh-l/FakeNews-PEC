That anti-racism requires Labour to defend the targets of antisemitism \u201chowever unlikable they might find us\u201d is absolutely correct. A distinction I wish he would have explored is the one between defending Israel\u2019s right to exist and defending its policies vis-a-vis the Palestinians.

What does Kahn-Harris mean when he says that the majority of British Jews are Zionists? He says, confusingly, that they either self-identify as such or support the principle of Israel as a Jewish state. Wouldn\u2019t the first group also do the second? But then, what does \u201cas a Jewish state\u201d imply? Repression of the Arabs in it? Claims on adjacent territory?

But Zionist Jews, who support, passively or actively, a racist Jewish state which is busily constructing an apartheid regime \u2013 Kahn-Harris does not enjoin them to show solidarity with anyone, either Palestinians or anti-Zionists.

What if the ethno-religious minorities he says should not be pursued have within them their own forms of racism? Surely these minorities internal to those groups should themselves still be called out, not least by the wider group to which they claim allegiance, for their discriminatory views. Otherwise we would be left defending or denying the indefensible, by turning a blind eye.
