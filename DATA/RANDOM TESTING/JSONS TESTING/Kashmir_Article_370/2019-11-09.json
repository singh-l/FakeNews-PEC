The disputed land will be given to a board of trustees for the construction of a temple for Hindu god Ram. The Ayodhya site has been one of the country\u2019s most controversial religious grounds since the Babri mosque, which had been standing since the 16th century, was reduced to rubble by Hindu fundamentalists during a 1992 riot in which more than 2,000 people died. In anticipation of the ruling \u2013 on whether to restore a temple or a mosque to the site \u2013 about 500 people were arrested and security was tightened as authorities tried to minimise the possibility of violence. Fearing riots, political leaders from across India\u2019s political spectrum have called for peace, while residents of Ayodhya city were banned from holding any events related to the temple.
