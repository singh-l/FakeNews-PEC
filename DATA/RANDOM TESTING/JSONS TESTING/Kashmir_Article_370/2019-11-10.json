And the \u201chit\u201d can be anything from alcohol or drugs to winning a debate to lifting a trophy on the sports field; from making a million to becoming a prime minister.

I too was packed off to boarding school, aged seven, and spent the first few nights sobbing myself to sleep. Monbiot\u2019s article reads as though his was an all-boys\u2019 school, as was mine, and there is one further way that such institutions influenced our development \u2013 the general attitude to girls.
