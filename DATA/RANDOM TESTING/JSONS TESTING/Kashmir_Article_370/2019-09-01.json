I was lucky enough to know her a little bit. People sometimes think she was a very grand lady, a giant figure in literature, but actually she was very down to earth and great fun to be around \u2013 she loved dancing, for example \u2013 and the film does a good job of getting this across.

      "bodyText": "Born in 1947 in Mumbai, Salman Rushdie is the author of 14 novels including Midnight\u2019s Children, which won the Booker prize in 1981, and has twice been named the best of all the Booker prizewinners. The 1988 publication of The Satanic Verses led Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran to issue a fatwa calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. The author now lives in New York, where he is a writer in residence at NYU. His latest novel, Quichotte, is published on 3 September. 1. Documentary Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am I saw this before Toni Morrison died and it seemed like a wonderful portrait of her, but now it feels even more significant. It\u2019s directed by the American photographer and film-maker Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, who secured amazing archival footage as well as extensive access to Morrison herself, even in these last years when she wasn\u2019t very well. I was lucky enough to know her a little bit. People sometimes think she was a very grand lady, a giant figure in literature, but actually she was very down to earth and great fun to be around \u2013 she loved dancing, for example \u2013 and the film does a good job of getting this across. It\u2019s a beautiful piece of film-making. 2. Music The Rolling Stones live in New Jersey Last month, I went to see the Rolling Stones live at the MetLife stadium and it was an amazing evening. I\u2019ve seen the Stones a lot over the years \u2013 the Observer sent me to report on the Voodoo Lounge tour at Wembley stadium in 1995 \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen their latest show twice. It\u2019s extraordinary that they\u2019re still doing it and are as good as they ever were. Mick appears to have recovered from his heart procedure \u2013 he\u2019s still zinging around the stage as fast as he ever did, while Keith remains firmly planted. When I went to see the show in London with my sons, I have never seen them so excited about going to a rock concert. It demonstrated to me that their music really has transcended all generations. It\u2019s music that everybody can share. 3.

Is the blended one supposed to be mixed race? Did they actually <em>go there</em> \u2013 and with chocolate? Indeed, so many questions... Is Cadbury aware of the ongoing segregation problems in parts of India or of the oppression in Kashmir? Does Cadbury truly believe that confectionary activism is the future for racial harmony?

I\u2019d say it was common knowledge that he drugged and sodomised 13-year-old Samantha Gailey in a whirlpool bath at Jack Nicholson\u2019s house. And that he scarpered from the US to avoid serving his rightful jail time. It\u2019s also well known how feted he has since been, including that rapturous applause when he won the best director Oscar for 2002\u2019s <em>The Pianist</em> (Polanski has since been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/12/roman-polanski-lawyer-oscar-academy-expulsion-director-sham\" title=\"\">expelled </a>from the Motion Picture Academy).</p> <p>As much as anyone could get away with a serious sexual crime, Polanski has. Yet still he seems to view himself as a victim of a global hounding by a society that simply doesn\u2019t understand the creative soul. In truth, he is a convicted child rapist who evaded full justice, and that\u2019s why he can\u2019t return to the US.</p> <p>It ill behoves either him or Bruckner to try to frame this as evidence of a vindictive philistine world. It remains a stain on those who still work with him, the standard, rather grotty argument being that a genius film director is different to a regular child rapist. With all that\u2019s passed in recent years, it says it all that he doesn\u2019t even bother to fake penitence. It\u2019s still all about him and how maligned he\u2019s been. His genius seems to be one thing, his self-awareness quite another.</p> <p>\u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist</p>",

It\u2019s usually nice, parents being friends with their kids, but, occasionally, things whiff more than a little of parental narcissism, where everything that happens to their child becomes more about them, and how they\u2019re feeling about it. Parents must resist inserting themselves into the central narrative of their child\u2019s every experience \u2013 accept that parental marginalisation, even outright irrelevance, at the university stage is not only inevitable, but it\u2019s healthy and crucial for the child\u2019s independence. The good news is that, if your child is going off to university, or to do anything else positive, you did it, you launched them, miraculously everything is going to plan. Time to send up a quiet hallelujah to the parenting gods and toast yourselves with a celebratory glass of wine. And if you miss them, don\u2019t fret \u2013 they\u2019ll soon be ringing home for money. Cadbury\u2019s choc won\u2019t sweeten the bitter taste of racism Cadbury has produced the first \u201cwoke\u2019 chocolate bar. The Unity Bar features different colours of chocolate \u2013 from dark to blended to milk to white. It was released on India\u2019s independence day, with the tagline: \u201cBecause sweet things happen when we unite.\u201d I\u2019ve yet to taste the Unity Bar, but here\u2019s hoping that earnest misplaced liberalism is as delicious as it sounds. There have already been witty Martin Luther King parodies on Twitter: \u201cI have a dream that my children will be judged not by the colour of their chocolate, but by the content of their creamy filling.\u201d Clearly, Cadbury meant no offence \u2013 quite the opposite \u2013 but it\u2019s still a little disturbing to see skin colours represented across the choccy spectrum. Is the blended one supposed to be mixed race? Did they actually go there \u2013 and with chocolate? Indeed, so many questions... Is Cadbury aware of the ongoing segregation problems in parts of India or of the oppression in Kashmir? Does Cadbury truly believe that confectionary activism is the future for racial harmony? Did no one in-house balk at the production stage of the wrapper, which appears to comprise illustrations of light and dark-skinned Indians? An important lesson has been learned: while, for some, chocolate is the answer to myriad woes, it probably isn\u2019t going to solve racism. Polanski\u2019s \u2018genius\u2019 in no way absolves his vile crime Roman Polanski is at it again. In press notes for his new film, An Officer and a Spy, when it was shown at the Venice film festival, Polanski, 86, appeared to agree with the interviewer, the philosopher Pascal Bruckner, that he was nothing less than a victim of \u201cneo-feminist McCarthyism\u201d \u2013 dismissing allegations of underage sexual abuse made against by him by several women. \u201cMost of the people who harass me do not know me and know nothing of the case,\u201d said Polanski of his 1977 conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. I\u2019d say it was common knowledge that he drugged and sodomised 13-year-old Samantha Gailey in a whirlpool bath at Jack Nicholson\u2019s house. And that he scarpered from the US to avoid serving his rightful jail time. It\u2019s also well known how feted he has since been, including that rapturous applause when he won the best director Oscar for 2002\u2019s The Pianist (Polanski has since been expelled from the Motion Picture Academy). As much as anyone could get away with a serious sexual crime, Polanski has. Yet still he seems to view himself as a victim of a global hounding by a society that simply doesn\u2019t understand the creative soul. In truth, he is a convicted child rapist who evaded full justice, and that\u2019s why he can\u2019t return to the US. It ill behoves either him or Bruckner to try to frame this as evidence of a vindictive philistine world. It remains a stain on those who still work with him, the standard, rather grotty argument being that a genius film director is different to a regular child rapist. With all that\u2019s passed in recent years, it says it all that he doesn\u2019t even bother to fake penitence. It\u2019s still all about him and how maligned he\u2019s been. His genius seems to be one thing, his self-awareness quite another. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",
