Many accuse India of wanting Kashmir\u2019s land, but not Kashmiris.</p> \n<p>In Srinagar, people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence, but the current clampdown is far more intense. Officers from the Central Reserve Police Force, India\u2019s armed police \u2013 who wear helmets and carry rifles \u2013 vastly outnumber Jammu and Kashmir police, who carry batons.

Landlines, mobile, internet coverage and, for many, cable TV have all been blocked.</p> \n<p>People cannot call relatives, or call ambulances if there is an emergency. Public transport is not running, which means those with health problems can only get to a hospital if they have a car \u2013 and even then they struggle to get far.</p> \n<p>Across the city, many roads are permanently blocked by loops of barbed wire. At checkpoints, people \u2013 including families with children \u2013 can be seen pleading with officers to let them pass. Most people, nervous that tensions were building last week, had stocked up on food and essentials, but it\u2019s not known how long the curfew will last.</p> \n<p>On some streets, broken bricks lie in the roads, left over from groups pelting the government forces with stones. At dusk, the sound of teargas canisters can be heard. The security presence is huge, but there are protests taking place at a neighbourhood-level.</p> \n<p>On Friday, the police announced that the curfew would be temporarily eased so that people could attend local mosques for Friday prayers. Some protests broke out afterwards, according to Associated Press, which reported that a group of people began throwing stones at security forces. Paramilitary troops responded by firing tear gas and pellets.</p> \n<p>Before prayers began , at least 50 people were being treated with wounds from pellet guns and rubber bullets at the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism.

      "bodyText": "Eid is just days away, and the central market in Srinagar, Lal Chowk, should be bustling with people. Every year crowds flock to its stalls to buy clothes, jewellery and sweets. Sheep and goats \u2013 traditionally offered as a sacrifice \u2013 are brought to the market by nomads from the Kashmir mountains. But this week Lal Chowk was deserted. On Wednesday, only two men \u2013 armed Indian police \u2013 stood opposite the market\u2019s shuttered shops and ice-cream parlours. Srinagar, the main city in Kashmir, is in complete lockdown following a dramatic announcement by the Indian government on Monday, which stripped the territory of its autonomy and divided it in two. \u201cOur lives will be different. This is injustice,\u201d says Nusrat Amin who was out on the empty streets of Srinagar trying to buy medicine. \u201cWe are compelled to come out on roads and fight against the oppression.\u201d Under the changes, Kashmir\u2019s constitution and flag will disappear. Rules that have prevented people from outside Kashmir buying land in the territory, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state, are also scrapped. Many Kashmiris fear the demography of the state, and their way of life, could be altered. Pakistan responded angrily, with the prime minister, Imran Khan, suggesting India could carry out ethnic cleansing, while China called the decision \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The voices of Kashmiris \u2013 whose future will be dramatically affected by the government\u2019s actions \u2013 have been almost completely silenced. Hours before the announcement, millions of people in the territory were placed under strict curfew and a wide-ranging communications blackout. In residential areas, where a few people venture outside to sit in side lanes, there is a deep sense of anger and betrayal. \u201c[On the one hand] they say Kashmir is ours, but at the same time they kill us,\u201d says Mohammad Rafiq, who describes himself as a citizen of Kashmir. \u201cWhatever they are doing here is by power and force,\u201d he says. Many accuse India of wanting Kashmir\u2019s land, but not Kashmiris. In Srinagar, people are used to curfews and living under a heavy security presence, but the current clampdown is far more intense. Officers from the Central Reserve Police Force, India\u2019s armed police \u2013 who wear helmets and carry rifles \u2013 vastly outnumber Jammu and Kashmir police, who carry batons. Officers, some of whom have never been to Kashmir before, cover every corner. \u201cWhen a child looks out from a window, he sees Indian forces with heavy weapons. What sort of impression would he get on his mind?\u201d says Rafiq. \u201cWill you win the people of Kashmir by love or with the gun or power?\u201d Communications blackout The clampdown on communications is equally harsh, and it is likely that people from outside the city have still not heard about the Indian government\u2019s announcement. Landlines, mobile, internet coverage and, for many, cable TV have all been blocked. People cannot call relatives, or call ambulances if there is an emergency. Public transport is not running, which means those with health problems can only get to a hospital if they have a car \u2013 and even then they struggle to get far. Across the city, many roads are permanently blocked by loops of barbed wire. At checkpoints, people \u2013 including families with children \u2013 can be seen pleading with officers to let them pass. Most people, nervous that tensions were building last week, had stocked up on food and essentials, but it\u2019s not known how long the curfew will last. On some streets, broken bricks lie in the roads, left over from groups pelting the government forces with stones. At dusk, the sound of teargas canisters can be heard. The security presence is huge, but there are protests taking place at a neighbourhood-level. On Friday, the police announced that the curfew would be temporarily eased so that people could attend local mosques for Friday prayers. Some protests broke out afterwards, according to Associated Press, which reported that a group of people began throwing stones at security forces. Paramilitary troops responded by firing tear gas and pellets. Before prayers began , at least 50 people were being treated with wounds from pellet guns and rubber bullets at the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital. Due to the communications blackout, it was unclear how many more needed medical help after Friday\u2019s protests. Hundreds of politicians and activists have reportedly been arrested and taken to temporary detention centres, apparently to prevent violence. Some of Kashmir\u2019s most prominent political leaders, people who have formed alliances with parties such as India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, remain in detention. The entire political spectrum in Kashmir is opposed to the revocation of the territory\u2019s special status. \u2018We have no hope\u2019 In Srinagar, Kashmir\u2019s biggest city, some are disillusioned with mainstream political leaders. Mir Shahid, a local shopkeeper who was sitting outside his closed shop says he has little faith. \u201cThese pro-Indian [Kashmiri] leaders are nothing and we have no hope from them,\u201d he says, pointing out that the voter turnout is extremely low. \u201cHow can we expect them to represent the people of Kashmir.

Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and others have transformed from autocracies to democratic members of the G20. Today, nations across Asia are innovative economies, flourishing democracies and contributors to global security. Any measurement of GDP size, military might or population illustrate how Asia could be the most important region in the world in the 21st century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/05/hong-kong-protests-china-collision-west\">The Hong Kong protests are putting China on a collision course with the west | Simon Tisdall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The future of Asia remains bright, but a crippling array of challenges threatens to upend its potential \u2013 and could have an immense impact on the US.</p> <p>Two of the most successful democracies in the region \u2013 South Korea and Japan, which are also US allies \u2013 are in the midst of a diplomatic brawl. The tensions are being driven by the legacy of Japan\u2019s occupation of South Korea in the first half of the 20th century \u2013 which remains a devastatingly potent political issue in both countries \u2013 and starkly divergent approaches to the region from the two current leaders. The countries\u2019 militaries have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/26/asia/south-korea-japan-spat-intl/index.html\">brushed up</a> against one another, a trade war is under way, and South Korean president Moon Jae-in recently, ominously, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBlueHouseENG/status/1157215834885898240\">said</a>: \u201cWe will never again lose to Japan.\u201d</p> <p>While the US would usually attempt to patch things up, the Trump administration has been mostly absent. A too little, too late effort by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, during a trilateral meeting with the Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/world/asia/japan-south-korea-feud.html\">reportedly</a> went so poorly that the two foreign ministers canceled their own bilateral meetings with Pompeo. South Korea is now reportedly considering withdrawing from a trilateral intelligence sharing agreement that was the product of intense diplomacy by previous US administrations. Close coordination with Seoul and Tokyo is essential to dealing with North Korea, and this rift could undermine the prospects for diplomacy with and deterrence against North Korea.</p> <p>That is especially concerning because North Korea has resumed missile testing, sending a reminder of how little recent diplomacy has achieved. And while diplomacy is the only way to address the threat from North Korea, Trump is so invested in the process \u2013 and his own narrative that it has been a success \u2013 that he can\u2019t even bring himself to criticize Kim Jong-un or the missile tests. In fact, Trump bends over backwards to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1157306442422136834\">defend</a> his ongoing bromance with Kim each time the North Korean leader sends another missile message. Meanwhile, North Korea continues building nuclear weapons and advancing its missile technology.</p> <p>Like with most dictators, Trump also spares his \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1156979443900067841\">friend</a>\u201d, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, from any criticism, even while escalating a trade war. The trade war, meanwhile, hurts American workers and the US economy, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-01/trade-war-latest-trump-powell-fed-rate-cut-economy-china\">according</a> to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. If the next round of US tariffs is implemented, some <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tariff-trade-war-annual-cost-1452411\">estimate</a> they could cost American families between $700 and $1,270 a year. The incoherence of Trump\u2019s approach on China undercuts American prosperity and has done nothing to advance our goals in addressing genuine problems with China.</p> <p>Trump also makes clear his willingness to ignore human rights in the hopes of smoothing the way for a trade deal. The people of Hong Kong are standing up for their democratic rights against growing repression from Beijing, and the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinas-army-just-released-a-video-showing-soldiers-practicing-shooting-protesters/2019/08/01/f884b9a6-b41e-11e9-acc8-1d847bacca73_story.html\">reportedly</a> massing its forces along the border with Hong Kong while the PLA\u2019s Hong Kong garrison sends threatening messages in what could be a deterrent to protesters or even a prelude to a Tiananmen-like crackdown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America\u2019s alliances, partnerships and moral authority in the region are fraying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But after talking about the prospects of a trade deal with China, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1157025123511283712\">made clear</a> that he doesn\u2019t care about what happens in Hong Kong: \u201cSomebody said that at some point they are going to want to stop [the riots]. But that\u2019s between Hong Kong and that\u2019s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China \u2026 they don\u2019t need advice.\u201d The message to Xi Jinping was loud and clear: All Trump cares about is trade, and he won\u2019t lift a finger if Xi violently cracks down on protesters.</p> <p>The list goes on. Not long after Trump claimed (falsely) to Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, that the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, asked Trump to mediate the India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir (the claim itself became a major diplomatic embarrassment for India) the government of India revoked Kashmir\u2019s special autonomous status, raising <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/08/07/748957876/pakistan-warns-indias-move-to-end-kashmir-s-special-status-could-lead-to-war\">tensions</a> between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. As the US withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, the US secretary of defense, Mark Esper, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/world/asia/china-us-nuclear-missiles.html\">stoked</a> new concerns of an arms race in Asia when he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/world/asia/us-missiles-asia-esper.html\">suggested</a> the US could deploy new ground-based missiles there. Pompeo recently <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-michael-r-pompeo-on-the-u-s-in-asia-economic-engagement-for-good/\">praised</a> the military-run government of Thailand as \u201creturning\u201d to democracy because it held sham elections. And Trump seems unaware of the atrocities being committed against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/jul/19/where-is-that-exactly-donald-trump-asks-rohingya-refugee-seeking-us-help-video\">Rohingya</a> in Myanmar or the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/20/20701802/donald-trump-nadia-murad-yazidi-uighur-rohingya-refugees-iraq-china-myanmar\">Uyghurs</a> in China. America\u2019s alliances, partnerships and moral authority in the region are fraying.</p> <p>Trump is an expert at stepping into controversy and making bad situations even worse, and his engagement in Asia is no exception. If these situations continue to spiral out of control, any one of the simmering problems from North Korea to Hong Kong to Kashmir could explode. And that could spell serious trouble for US prosperity and national security.</p> <ul> <li><p>Michael H Fuchs is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, and a former deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Asia\u2019s historical, political and economic landmines are increasingly blowing up, and Donald Trump seems intent on accelerating the damage in ways that could threaten US national security and prosperity. Things didn\u2019t always seem so bleak. Analysts have long heralded the coming of the \u201cAsian century\u201d. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and others have transformed from autocracies to democratic members of the G20. Today, nations across Asia are innovative economies, flourishing democracies and contributors to global security. Any measurement of GDP size, military might or population illustrate how Asia could be the most important region in the world in the 21st century. The future of Asia remains bright, but a crippling array of challenges threatens to upend its potential \u2013 and could have an immense impact on the US. Two of the most successful democracies in the region \u2013 South Korea and Japan, which are also US allies \u2013 are in the midst of a diplomatic brawl. The tensions are being driven by the legacy of Japan\u2019s occupation of South Korea in the first half of the 20th century \u2013 which remains a devastatingly potent political issue in both countries \u2013 and starkly divergent approaches to the region from the two current leaders. The countries\u2019 militaries have brushed up against one another, a trade war is under way, and South Korean president Moon Jae-in recently, ominously, said: \u201cWe will never again lose to Japan.\u201d While the US would usually attempt to patch things up, the Trump administration has been mostly absent. A too little, too late effort by the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, during a trilateral meeting with the Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers reportedly went so poorly that the two foreign ministers canceled their own bilateral meetings with Pompeo. South Korea is now reportedly considering withdrawing from a trilateral intelligence sharing agreement that was the product of intense diplomacy by previous US administrations. Close coordination with Seoul and Tokyo is essential to dealing with North Korea, and this rift could undermine the prospects for diplomacy with and deterrence against North Korea. That is especially concerning because North Korea has resumed missile testing, sending a reminder of how little recent diplomacy has achieved. And while diplomacy is the only way to address the threat from North Korea, Trump is so invested in the process \u2013 and his own narrative that it has been a success \u2013 that he can\u2019t even bring himself to criticize Kim Jong-un or the missile tests. In fact, Trump bends over backwards to defend his ongoing bromance with Kim each time the North Korean leader sends another missile message. Meanwhile, North Korea continues building nuclear weapons and advancing its missile technology. Like with most dictators, Trump also spares his \u201cfriend\u201d, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, from any criticism, even while escalating a trade war. The trade war, meanwhile, hurts American workers and the US economy, according to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. If the next round of US tariffs is implemented, some estimate they could cost American families between $700 and $1,270 a year. The incoherence of Trump\u2019s approach on China undercuts American prosperity and has done nothing to advance our goals in addressing genuine problems with China. Trump also makes clear his willingness to ignore human rights in the hopes of smoothing the way for a trade deal. The people of Hong Kong are standing up for their democratic rights against growing repression from Beijing, and the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is reportedly massing its forces along the border with Hong Kong while the PLA\u2019s Hong Kong garrison sends threatening messages in what could be a deterrent to protesters or even a prelude to a Tiananmen-like crackdown. But after talking about the prospects of a trade deal with China, Trump made clear that he doesn\u2019t care about what happens in Hong Kong: \u201cSomebody said that at some point they are going to want to stop [the riots]. But that\u2019s between Hong Kong and that\u2019s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China \u2026 they don\u2019t need advice.\u201d The message to Xi Jinping was loud and clear: All Trump cares about is trade, and he won\u2019t lift a finger if Xi violently cracks down on protesters. The list goes on. Not long after Trump claimed (falsely) to Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, that the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, asked Trump to mediate the India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir (the claim itself became a major diplomatic embarrassment for India) the government of India revoked Kashmir\u2019s special autonomous status, raising tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. As the US withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, the US secretary of defense, Mark Esper, stoked new concerns of an arms race in Asia when he suggested the US could deploy new ground-based missiles there. Pompeo recently praised the military-run government of Thailand as \u201creturning\u201d to democracy because it held sham elections. And Trump seems unaware of the atrocities being committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar or the Uyghurs in China. America\u2019s alliances, partnerships and moral authority in the region are fraying. Trump is an expert at stepping into controversy and making bad situations even worse, and his engagement in Asia is no exception. If these situations continue to spiral out of control, any one of the simmering problems from North Korea to Hong Kong to Kashmir could explode. And that could spell serious trouble for US prosperity and national security.

Interviews with children and leaked documents from Amazon\u2019s Chinese supplier, Foxconn, show that some youngsters have been asked to work nights and overtime in the factory in Hengyang in breach of Chinese labour laws. The children have been drafted in from local schools and classed as \u201cinterns\u201d, with teachers paid to accompany them to work and pressurise their pupils to take on extra work in return for improved employment prospects at the factory. One pupil said she worked up to 10 hours a day in sweltering conditions. \u201cI had no choice, I could only endure this,\u201d she says. According to company documents, Foxconn pays \u201cinterns\u201d a basic wage of \u00a31.18 an hour. Alexa devices start from around \u00a350 for a basic Echo Dot model.</p> \n<p>When confronted by the documents, Foxconn admitted employing children to work overtime and nights. The company, which also makes iPhones for Apple, said it had taken \u201cimmediate action to fix the situation\u201d.

In his letter to cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, the Labour leader says it would be an \u201cunprecedented, unconstitutional and anti-democratic abuse of power\u201d if the prime minister lost a no-confidence vote on no deal in September but hung on to power long enough to hold an election after the Brexit deadline of 31 October. Corbyn says electoral rules are meant to prevent governments taking major policy decisions during an election campaign.

Assistant chief constable Alan Todd accused the ringleaders of using women and children as human shields, forcing police to withdraw. * * * Arms \u2018disgrace\u2019 \u2013 Officials from Hong Kong have been invited by the government to attend a major arms fair in London despite a promise by ministers to halt exports of teargas to the crisis-hit territory. The invitation to the DSEI show, which showcases security and military products, was confirmed by Liz Truss\u2019s international trade department. Anti-arms campaigners said it was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that Hong Kong police were using UK-made weapons against protesters and that they had been encouraged to buy more. Meanwhile, the US has called China a \u201cthuggish regime\u201d for targeting an American diplomat who met some demonstrators. * * * Italian turmoil \u2013 Italy is set for more political instability after the leader of the country\u2019s far-right League party called for new elections after declaring that he could no longer work with his coalition partners. Last night\u2019s move by Matteo Salvini comes after months of fighting between his party and the Five Star Movement (M5S), who came together last year after their populist message swept aside Italy\u2019s established order in elections last year. The bickering came to a head this week when M5S failed to prevent the go-ahead of a plan to build a high-speed rail link to France. * * * Kashmir tensions \u2013 After India\u2019s decision this week to strip Kashmir of its autonomy and divide it in two, tensions with Pakistan have risen to new heights. A strict curfew and a communications blackout mean very little news has emerged from the disputed region. But in one of the first accounts from the streets of the main city, Srinangar, our reporters tell of a place under siege. Heavily armed Indian troops have replaced local police on every street corner and roads are permanently blocked by loops of barbed wire. One resident says: \u201cWhen a child looks out from a window, he sees Indian forces with heavy weapons. What sort of impression would he get on his mind? Will you win the people of Kashmir by love or with the gun or power?\u201d Today in Focus podcast: why Newcastle United fans want Ashley out As the Premier League season kicks off this weekend, David Conn examines the fraught relationship between Newcastle United fans and the club\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, that has led to thousands of supporters threatening to boycott Sunday\u2019s home game against Arsenal. Plus, Ammar Kalia on the Miss England beauty contest. Lunchtime read: Francis Ford Coppola and the final Apocalypse It is 40 years since the release of Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s legendary film exploring human morality in the Vietnam war. To mark the anniversary, Coppola, now aged 80, has re-edited his epic work to produce the \u201cFinal Cut\u201d, which he hopes will restore some of the film\u2019s radical edge. Kevin EG Perry has travelled to Coppola\u2019s estate in the Napa Valley to talk to him about the new edition and discovers that the director doesn\u2019t view the film as anti-war, admitting that it glorifies violence. Coppola also ruminates on the chasm that separates the new Hollywood from the famously chaotic filming of Apocalypse (\u201c\u2026Dennis Hopper, God knows what he was doing), but says that young film-makers are still taking risks. \u201cWe\u2019re in a blossoming of cinema art, I feel. It\u2019s just that they do it with their parent\u2019s credit cards.\u201d Sport J\u00fcrgen Klopp believes Liverpool will improve this season without new signings and 98 points may not be required to win the Premier League given increased competition among the leading pack. A ban on tackling above the waist is to be trialled in a radical attempt to make rugby union a safer sport. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have rejoined the ATP players\u2019 council, an intriguing twist to the power struggle at the top of the men\u2019s game. And the American gymnast, Simone Biles, was in tears as she spoke about the anger and disappointment she feels about the handling of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal. Business There\u2019s more drama for the once-untouchable City fund manager Neil Woodford as Hargreaves Lansdown waived \u00a32m in fees for nearly 300,000 customers locked in his suspended flagship fund. And Burford Capital, which Woodford is a large investor, has accused a US hedge fund of making \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d claims that have wiped more than \u00a31bn off its value, and warned the accusations could amount to market manipulation. In the US, Uber lost $5bn in the last three months, its worst ever quarterly loss, sending its shares down by 10%. The company claims its big investment programme will bear fruit in coming years but investors are nervous. Future trading suggests the FTSE100 will open flat this morning. The pound is buying $1.213 and \u20ac1.084.
