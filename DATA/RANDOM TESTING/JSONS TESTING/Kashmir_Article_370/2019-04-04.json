      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel has pledged the European Union\u2019s support for averting a hard border on the island of Ireland despite concern this could undermine the single market in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The German chancellor expressed solidarity with the Irish government in a visit to Dublin on Thursday and urged the UK to present a viable plan to avert crashing out of the EU next week. Asked if averting a border was compatible with protecting the single market, Merkel told a press conference: \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way \u2026 we simply have to do this, we simply have to be successful.\u201d The chancellor was speaking after meeting the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and a group of people from Northern Ireland and the border area who told of lives and livelihoods lost during the Troubles.

It will remain with the Lords until Monday after squeaking through the House of Commons by one vote on Wednesday night. Despite the public expression of solidarity from the EU\u2019s powerhouse, Ireland is coming under mounting pressure from EU members to show how it will avoid a hard border while protecting the integrity of the single market.
