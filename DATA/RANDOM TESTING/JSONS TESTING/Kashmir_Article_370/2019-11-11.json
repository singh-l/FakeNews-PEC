      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s biggest backer, the union Unite, has told the high court that the party\u2019s parliamentary candidate in Redcar is unfit to be an MP. Anna Turley, who was the Labour MP in the North Yorkshire town until last week and hopes to regain the seat, is suing Unite over an article published on the Skwawkbox blog that related to an application she made for union membership. Turley \u2013 a moderate who three years ago called the Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, an \u201carsehole\u201d on Twitter \u2013 claims the article, which contained a press statement from Unite, libelled her. She is also suing Stephen Walker, a journalist who edits and publishes the hard-left blog, and says Unite misused her private information. The hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London, which began on Monday, is expected to last three days and will hear from witnesses such as Labour\u2019s Ruth Smeeth appearing via video link, statements from former MPs and testimony from high-ranking union officials. It could prove to be highly embarrassing as Labour MPs and Unite attempt to put on a show of togetherness during the general election campaign. A barrister representing Unite and Walker told a judge that Turley had been dishonest and \u201cregrettably\u201d was not fit to be an MP. Anthony Hudson QC told Mr Justice Nicklin that Turley\u2019s dishonesty \u201cpermeates through every part of the case\u201d. He claimed she had been \u201cdeceiving people so she could vote against Mr McCluskey and oust Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. The case relates to Turley\u2019s application to join Unite in December 2016, which she submitted the day before the announcement of a Unite election for general secretary. McCluskey, one of Corbyn\u2019s most influential advisers, was facing a possible challenge from the moderate Gerard Coyne. An article appeared on Skwawkbox in April 2017 that claimed Turley had broken the rules because she had joined Unite\u2019s community section, which was supposed to be exclusively for unwaged members, and she had made a false declaration to do so. A Unite spokesperson was quoted in the article as saying: \u201cAnyone joining on a fraudulent basis will prompt an investigation. A complaint has been received and is being investigated.\u201d According to Turley\u2019s counsel, she joined as a Unite Community member and was told by Unite in March 2017 that she should move to become an \u201cindustrial\u201d member. Turley replied days later apologising and asking how she should transfer her membership. Kate Wilson, for Turley, said the Skwawkbox article in April 2017 conveyed the meaning that Turley had acted dishonestly in submitting her application. According to court documents, Turley applied to join Unite Community after she read about the challenge to McCluskey\u2019s leadership on the Birthday Club Group of MPs, a confidential WhatsApp group of Labour moderates. The Birthday Club WhatsApp was set up to help like-minded MPs to arrange celebrations and became a forum for dissent. On 5 December 2016, Smeeth, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent North and a Unite member, sent a message to the group\u2019s members saying McCluskey was to resign to trigger an early election for a new general secretary. Smeeth wrote to the group that it was \u201cgame on in Unite\u201d and suggested that the MPs could join Unite Community, according to court papers. The Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Chris Leslie asked Smeeth to share the link to sign up for membership, the documents claims. After receiving the link, Turley replied: \u201cDone. Now for a shower.\u201d Documents submitted to court show Unite discussed contacting Turley to inform her that she was not entitled to be a Unite Community member in both January and February 2017 and finally contacted her in March. Six days after receiving an email, Turley replied saying she did not know she had joined the wrong section and asking how she could transfer to the right section. Walker, a journalist who is close to Unite, contacted the union about Turley\u2019s membership in early April and received the statement that appeared in the Skwawkbox article, court documents said. Unite and Walker\u2019s legal team will claim that Turley acted \u201cdishonestly and deceitfully\u201d in the run-up to the court case by lying about the circumstances in which she joined Unite and then trying to cover up those lies, court documents show. According to Turley\u2019s legal team, Unite has admitted breaching its client\u2019s rights under the Data Protection Act. The case continues.",

The Guardian poll tracker, which tracks all national polls over a rolling 14-day period weighting each equally, had, as of 8 November, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/oct/31/uk-general-election-2019-poll-tracker\">the Conservatives way out in front</a> on 39%, ahead of Labour on 27%. The Liberal Democrats are on 16% and the Brexit party on 9%. </p> <p>Compare that with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2017/results\">the vote shares in the 2017 general election</a>. The Conservatives achieved 42.4%, four points ahead of where they are now, but Labour\u2019s relative position today is far worse. Last time, the party climbed to 40%, 13 points ahead of its current position.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/tracker-zip/giv-3902m4HcHbcjQvPO/\" data-alt=\"poll tracker graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/tracker-zip/giv-3902m4HcHbcjQvPO/\">poll tracker graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Both benefited from what appears now to have been a brief and anomalous return to two-party national politics: in 2017, the post-coalition Lib Dems were on just 7.4% and Ukip (the closest to the Brexit party today) 1.8%.</p> <h2>But what does that mean for the actual election result?</h2> <p>Translating poll figures into how many parliamentary seats will be won is notoriously tricky, and polling firms are wary of taking that task on themselves. Psephologists, arguably braver individuals, do, however, try.</p> <p>One of the better known publicly available models, <a href=\"https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/homepage.html\">Electoral Calculus, estimates that on current averages</a>, the Conservatives will win 370 seats, and a sweeping majority of 90, with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour a distant second on 186.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/waffle-zip/giv-3902OXoqdLGkPVsa/\" data-alt=\"Electoral Calculus graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/waffle-zip/giv-3902OXoqdLGkPVsa/\">Electoral Calculus graphic</a> </figure>  <p>It is a Tory lead that has increased from 30 October, when it was clear that an election was taking place. At that point, the site was predicting a Tory majority of 76. And the current prediction still allows for the Scottish National party to increase its position in Scotland, taking 48 seats, up from the 35 it achieved in 2017.</p> <h2>What about the dynamics of the campaign?</h2> <p>Pundits argue endlessly about which events in a campaign cut through to voters, although the traditional view had largely been that election campaigns make surprisingly little difference to the final outcome.</p> <p>That theory was shattered by the 2017 campaign, when Corbyn\u2019s Labour came from 21 points behind to finish with a deficit of just 2.4%. That gap, of course, produced the hung parliament.</p> <p>It is debatable too, who has had the worst start this time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/jacob-rees-mogg-claims-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense\">Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s callous initial remarks about the Grenfell Tower victims</a> and the enforced resignation of Alun Cairns as Welsh secretary have been cancelled out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp\">Tom Watson\u2019s departure</a> and the sight of former Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/former-labour-mp-ian-austin-urges-voters-back-boris-johnson\">Ian Austin urging voters to back Boris Johnson</a>.</p> <p>Polling averages also lag events by a couple of weeks, so any genuine movement in sentiment takes a while to show. So in this campaign, the trend lines have been a little different: the Conservatives are up three points, Labour up two. Losing out are the Lib Dems, down two and the Brexit party, down one. Other movements and roundings account for the remaining differences.</p> <p>So a little over a week into the campaign, there is one tentative trend: a shift in support towards the two big parties, which is yet to be sustained for long enough to count as a consequential shift. Above all, at least at this point, there is an election-winning Tory lead.</p> <h2>What about constituency polls \u2013 is there not a different story?</h2> <p>Although theoretically attractive, polling in individual constituencies is not only expensive to conduct but notoriously unreliable. Nonetheless, the Lib Dems commissioned a string of polls from Survation in an attempt to show their position as positively as possible.</p> <p>They purport to show the Lib Dems leading in Labour held <a href=\"https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/cambridge-news/lib-dems-could-steal-cambridge-17174230\">Cambridge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-polling-puts-liberal-democrats-beating-labour-mp-stephen-morgan-in-portsmouth-south-1-9129758\">Portsmouth South</a> \u2013 with a 15- or 16-point swing from Corbyn\u2019s party \u2013 and taking a seat from the Tories in <a href=\"https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/news/general-election-2019-shock-poll-puts-liberal-democrats-ahead-of-tories-in-south-cambridgeshire-9088627/\">South Cambridgeshire</a>, although that was where Heidi Allen had been expected to stand for the party.</p> <p>But pollsters such as Martin Boon, who founded Deltapoll, warn that there is a \u201cdisconnect between these results and the national picture\u201d because they suggest the Lib Dems doing far better locally that national projections suggest.</p> <h2>What about regional polls \u2013 can they be more revealing?</h2> <p>Regional polls can be particularly helpful in capturing variations at an easily understood level and are worth keeping an eye on.

      "bodyText": "Politicians love to hate them, until they show a result that suits. Journalists caution against reading too much into them, but can easily be tempted to take them seriously. No wonder, then, that the voting public can easily be bemused by the endless supply of election opinion polls: that appear to show one thing and yet have little clear bearing on the final result. As the general election campaign gets under way, and with the so-called \u201chorse race\u201d attracting enormous interest, the Guardian is launching its \u201cpolling station\u201d coverage \u2013 not adding to the noise that the polls produce, but helping you pick out the parts that are useful. What do the polls actually measure? Pollsters ask the public a range of questions, but in the end one counts above all, traditionally: \u201cIf there were a general election tomorrow, which party would you vote for?\u201d Their samples are representative of the population but cover Great Britain only \u2013 with Northern Ireland excluded because none of the principal Westminster parties is competitive there. Individual polls can vary by five points or more, so it can be more helpful to follow the averages. The Guardian poll tracker, which tracks all national polls over a rolling 14-day period weighting each equally, had, as of 8 November, the Conservatives way out in front on 39%, ahead of Labour on 27%. The Liberal Democrats are on 16% and the Brexit party on 9%. Compare that with the vote shares in the 2017 general election. The Conservatives achieved 42.4%, four points ahead of where they are now, but Labour\u2019s relative position today is far worse. Last time, the party climbed to 40%, 13 points ahead of its current position. Both benefited from what appears now to have been a brief and anomalous return to two-party national politics: in 2017, the post-coalition Lib Dems were on just 7.4% and Ukip (the closest to the Brexit party today) 1.8%. But what does that mean for the actual election result? Translating poll figures into how many parliamentary seats will be won is notoriously tricky, and polling firms are wary of taking that task on themselves. Psephologists, arguably braver individuals, do, however, try. One of the better known publicly available models, Electoral Calculus, estimates that on current averages, the Conservatives will win 370 seats, and a sweeping majority of 90, with Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour a distant second on 186. It is a Tory lead that has increased from 30 October, when it was clear that an election was taking place. At that point, the site was predicting a Tory majority of 76. And the current prediction still allows for the Scottish National party to increase its position in Scotland, taking 48 seats, up from the 35 it achieved in 2017. What about the dynamics of the campaign? Pundits argue endlessly about which events in a campaign cut through to voters, although the traditional view had largely been that election campaigns make surprisingly little difference to the final outcome. That theory was shattered by the 2017 campaign, when Corbyn\u2019s Labour came from 21 points behind to finish with a deficit of just 2.4%. That gap, of course, produced the hung parliament. It is debatable too, who has had the worst start this time. Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s callous initial remarks about the Grenfell Tower victims and the enforced resignation of Alun Cairns as Welsh secretary have been cancelled out by Tom Watson\u2019s departure and the sight of former Labour MP Ian Austin urging voters to back Boris Johnson. Polling averages also lag events by a couple of weeks, so any genuine movement in sentiment takes a while to show. So in this campaign, the trend lines have been a little different: the Conservatives are up three points, Labour up two. Losing out are the Lib Dems, down two and the Brexit party, down one. Other movements and roundings account for the remaining differences. So a little over a week into the campaign, there is one tentative trend: a shift in support towards the two big parties, which is yet to be sustained for long enough to count as a consequential shift. Above all, at least at this point, there is an election-winning Tory lead. What about constituency polls \u2013 is there not a different story? Although theoretically attractive, polling in individual constituencies is not only expensive to conduct but notoriously unreliable. Nonetheless, the Lib Dems commissioned a string of polls from Survation in an attempt to show their position as positively as possible. They purport to show the Lib Dems leading in Labour held Cambridge and Portsmouth South \u2013 with a 15- or 16-point swing from Corbyn\u2019s party \u2013 and taking a seat from the Tories in South Cambridgeshire, although that was where Heidi Allen had been expected to stand for the party. But pollsters such as Martin Boon, who founded Deltapoll, warn that there is a \u201cdisconnect between these results and the national picture\u201d because they suggest the Lib Dems doing far better locally that national projections suggest. What about regional polls \u2013 can they be more revealing? Regional polls can be particularly helpful in capturing variations at an easily understood level and are worth keeping an eye on. Two interesting regional polls from YouGov (a firm that is showing a big Tory lead nationally) have already emerged. The first, in London, records that Labour still leads with 39%, but down 16 points on the 2017 general election; the Conservatives are at 29%, down four points, and the Lib Dems up 10 points to 19%, potentially helping Jo Swinson\u2019s party take seats in south-west London. Labour gains in 2017 such as Battersea and Kensington are at risk, and the party misses out on key seats it will have hoped to gain. Finally, a poll in Wales for ITV showed that Labour had staged a mini-recovery to retake the lead, at 29%, making a gain of four points from mid-October. But Corbyn\u2019s party is still 20 points down from its 2017 general election result there, and Prof Roger Awan-Scully has forecast that Labour would lose 10 seats out of 28 held, with the Conservatives picking up nine and the Lib Dems one. So far, the regional picture mirrors the national one.",

Inquiring into the causes of veterans\u2019 suicide will save lives. So, how might the money (the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse cost some $370m) be better spent? On more commemoration perhaps? No such debate accompanied the announcement that the federal government would profligately spend $500m on expanding the war memorial, apparently so that it might display more machinery of war, commemorate Australian participation in existing conflicts, and because of the questionable claim that the institution has a therapeutic role to play for veterans (which is not, incidentally, part of the AWM mandate).

That would really help the living. If you can escape the politicians for some quiet, dignified reflection on the true human cost of war today, a haunting new book by Paul Byrnes, The Lost Boys \u2013 The untold stories of the under-age soldiers who fought in the First world War, is a good place to start. It is one of the most poignant books I\u2019ve read in recent years about Australia\u2019s first world war experience.
