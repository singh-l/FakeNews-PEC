She provides a written statement with further examples and allegations against Rush. With Norvill\u2019s cooperation, the newspaper has enough evidence to submit a new, amended truth defence.

Neil Armfield, the director of King Lear, testifies that he did not notice anything \u201ccreepy\u201d from Rush. Earlier, the Daily Telegraph said Armfield himself told Rush off for his behaviour with Norvill, saying that the scene was \u201ccreepy and unclear\u201d. The newspaper alleges that Armfield told Rush to be \u201cmore paternal\u201d and less \u201ccreepy\u201d.

Nevin says that Norvill once came to her, crying, complaining about \u201cthe trouble with Geoffrey\u201d. But Nevin said she interpreted this to mean \u201cthe trouble she was having with [acting the role of] Cordelia\u201d. The Daily Telegraph alleges that Norvill had indeed told Nevin about sexual harassment, but Nevin denies this.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/30/eryn-jean-norvill-alleges-geoffrey-rush-touched-her-breast-and-left-her-frightened\">30 October</a>: Norvill testifies. She says the cast of senior actors and friends of Rush were \u201ccomplicit\u201d in endorsing his behaviour, and \u201cpressured\u201d her to put up with it. She says there was a \u201cdaily\u201d pattern of \u201csexual harassment\u201d from Rush that made her feel \u201cbelittled\u201d and \u201ctrapped\u201d. \u201cI was at the bottom of the rung in terms of hierarchy and Geoffrey was definitely at the top,\u201d she says. \u201cI was looking at a room that was complicit, my director didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it, so I felt quashed in terms of my ability to find allies.\u201d</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/01/geoffrey-rush-touched-eryn-jean-norvills-breast-on-stage-fellow-actor-tells-court\">1 November</a>: Mark Leonard Winter, a fellow cast member in King Lear, says he saw Rush cup Norvill\u2019s breast. \u201cI saw Geoffrey\u2019s hand cupping around the bottom of EJ\u2019s breast, which was something I hadn\u2019t seen before on stage,\u201d he says.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/02/geoffrey-rush-trial-faces-long-delay-if-daily-telegraph-is-allowed-new-witness\">2-6 November</a>: The Witness X saga. On 2 November, the Daily Telegraph makes a last-minute application to add a new witness to the case. The witness\u2019s name is suppressed, so the judge calls them \u201cWitness X\u201d. The Telegraph says Witness X has new information of Rush being \u201ca pervert\u201d and \u201csexual predator\u201d, which would prove the truth of its reporting. Rush brings in a third barrister \u2013 Kieran Smark SC \u2013 to oppose Witness X\u2019s evidence being allowed. Four days later, Wigney says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/06/geoffrey-rush-defamation-trial-judge-throws-out-bid-to-introduce-mystery-witness\">Witness X is not allowed</a>, because the allegations had nothing to do with the 2016 King Lear production.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/08/daily-telegraph-articles-on-geoffrey-rush-irresponsible-journalism-court-told\">8 November</a>: The final day of the trial. Wigney starts work on the decision.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>What kinds of ruling could the judge make?</strong></h2> <p>Without predicting who wins the case, there are a range of different rulings the judge could make.</p> <p>When someone sues for defamation, they have to lay out what the particular negative imputations are that they are fighting. As we\u2019ve seen, in this case Rush says the article implied he was \u201ca pervert\u201d, \u201ca sexual predator\u201d and committed sexual assault during the production.</p> <p>There are three questions that the judge has to ask.</p> <p>The first is whether these imputations were in fact conveyed by the article. The Daily Telegraph denies that its article\u2019s words and photo even conveyed that Rush was \u201ca pervert\u201d and similar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/nov/30/your-right-to-know-how-australias-defamation-law-stifles-public-interest-journalism\">Your right to know: how Australia's defamation law stifles public interest journalism | Richard Ackland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wigney must look at each imputation and decide whether it was conveyed (in the mind of the \u201cordinary, reasonable reader\u201d). It\u2019s not technically a legal defence \u2013 but the Telegraph will win if Wigney rules that none of the imputations were conveyed.</p> <p>The second question is whether the imputations, if conveyed, are defamatory \u2013 that is, if they will they damage Rush\u2019s reputation. This will likely not be an issue, as the Telegraph has admitted that if conveyed, the allegations are clearly defamatory.</p> <p>Finally, if the above are conveyed, the last decision is whether the Daily Telegraph has a defence \u2013 namely the truth defence.</p> <p>According to the legislation, something does not need to be wholly true, but rather \u201c<a href=\"https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2005/77/part4/div2/sec25\">substantially true</a>\u201d. The bar is set as \u201con the balance of probabilities\u201d \u2013 lower than the bar in criminal trials of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that each imputation can be ruled on separately. For example, it\u2019s possible that the truth defence will be approved for the imputation that Rush is \u201ca pervert\u201d, but not that he \u201ccommitted sexual assault\u201d. This means Rush would be paid out damages for some of the imputations, but not all of them.</p> <h2><strong>Could there be an appeal?</strong></h2> <p>No matter what happens, an appeal is very likely over the costs \u2013 coming from either party.</p> <p>Both parties could also appeal over the verdict \u2013 but only if they believe the judge made an error of law, not of fact.</p> <p>An example of an error of law is if the judge misinterpreted how the defence of truth worked, and gave it a higher bar for proof than it should have had.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On Thursday, the verdict will be handed down in the Geoffrey Rush defamation case. Some of Australia\u2019s most recognisable actors have testified in the high-profile case. It has been a long process, with constantly changing defences, surprise witnesses and the confusing intricacies of Australia\u2019s unique defamation laws. What is the trial all about? Geoffrey Rush is suing the News Corp-owned Daily Telegraph newspaper over an article that alleged he sexually harassed and inappropriately touched a female co-star during a Sydney theatre production of King Lear. What was actually printed? The article was published on 30 November 2017, with the headline \u201cKing Leer\u201d. It said the Sydney Theatre Company had received an anonymous complaint against Rush that he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d during the run of King Lear in 2015 and 2016. The article did not contain further details. Rush immediately denied the allegation. The Daily Telegraph published the article without permission from the complainant \u2013 who had never wanted to go public. What are the legal issues? Rush claims the Daily Telegraph\u2019s article conveyed the imputation that he is a \u201cpervert\u201d, a \u201csexual predator\u201d and \u201ccommitted sexual assault\u201d (and more). He will win the case if he proves these implications were conveyed by the article and are not true. The Daily Telegraph is arguing the defence of truth. It has submitted evidence from the complainant and from other actors that Rush did a range of things that it alleges constitute being a \u201csexual predator\u201d and similar. It says that in one rehearsal, Rush \u201chovered his hands\u201d above his co-star\u2019s chest while her eyes were closed and \u201cmade groping gestures in the air with two cupped hands intended to simulate groping and fondling breasts\u201d. The complainant, Eryn Jean Norvill, played Cordelia, the daughter of Rush\u2019s King Lear. She told the court: \u201cHe was stroking, gesturing up and down my torso [and] groping above my breasts ... and kind of raising his eyebrows, bulging his eyes, smiling, licking his lips.\u201d Norvill also said Rush \u201ctraced across\u201d her breast with his hand on a different day, put his hand under her shirt on her lower back \u2013 also on a different day \u2013 and sent her a text that said he thought of her \u201cmore than is socially appropriate\u201d. Why is so much evidence being given that wasn\u2019t in the article? When assessing the defence of truth, the judge does not look at whether that proof was in the original article. The question is whether the imputations \u2013 that Rush was a \u201cpervert\u201d, \u201cpredator\u201d and committed sexual assault during the King Lear production \u2013 are true in general. Thus both sides can put forward evidence that wasn\u2019t in the article. What are the punishments for both sides? Defamation lawsuits can only result in damages \u2013 that is, money \u2013 being awarded. Neither party can be sentenced to prison time if they lose. If Rush wins, he will get compensation for the harm the article did to his reputation. This can include estimates of future acting jobs. He has also applied for \u201caggravated damages\u201d, which awards more money if the judge finds the Daily Telegraph acted unreasonably or maliciously in publishing. If the Daily Telegraph wins, it will be awarded costs. In its closing submission, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s lawyer said that if the paper loses, it will oppose the application for aggravated damages, but won\u2019t oppose paying compensation. The size of the payout is up to the judge. What were the key moments? It has been a long and drawn-out court process. December 2017: Rush launches his defamation action. February 2018: The Daily Telegraph submits its (first) defence \u2013 and more details emerge. It is here that the court hears allegations that Rush \u201cinappropriately touched\u201d Norvill on stage, on five occasions, and that he followed her into a bathroom during a party, and stood outside her cubicle until she told him to \u201cfuck off\u201d. March: The judge, Justice Michael Wigney, throws out the entirety of the Daily Telegraph\u2019s truth defence because it lacked detail. At this point, Norvill had refused to testify for the Daily Telegraph. Without the truth defence, it is highly likely that the newspaper will lose the case. 3 August: Norvill agrees to testify. She provides a written statement with further examples and allegations against Rush. With Norvill\u2019s cooperation, the newspaper has enough evidence to submit a new, amended truth defence. Previously, the Daily Telegraph had published the initial story against her wishes, and without asking for permission. Norvill had never wanted her complaint made public. 22 October: The trial begins. Rush testifies, saying the articles had rendered him sleepless and caused distress to his wife and children. \u201cIt\u2019s been the worst 11 months of my life,\u201d he says. 24 October: On day three of the trial, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s barrister, Tom Blackburn SC , alleges that Rush put his hand under Norvill\u2019s shirt and \u201cstroked his fingers on and just above the line of her jeans\u201d, until Norvill told him \u201cplease stop that\u201d. Rush says this is untrue. 25 October: A roll call of Australian theatre stars come to Rush\u2019s defence. Neil Armfield, the director of King Lear, testifies that he did not notice anything \u201ccreepy\u201d from Rush. Earlier, the Daily Telegraph said Armfield himself told Rush off for his behaviour with Norvill, saying that the scene was \u201ccreepy and unclear\u201d. The newspaper alleges that Armfield told Rush to be \u201cmore paternal\u201d and less \u201ccreepy\u201d. But on the witness stand, Armfield denies ever saying this. \u201cI\u2019ve already said I have no memory of such a note,\u201d he says. 29 October: Acclaimed actor Robyn Nevin, who was also in the King Lear cast, also defends Rush, saying she never saw inappropriate behaviour. Nevin says that Norvill once came to her, crying, complaining about \u201cthe trouble with Geoffrey\u201d. But Nevin said she interpreted this to mean \u201cthe trouble she was having with [acting the role of] Cordelia\u201d. The Daily Telegraph alleges that Norvill had indeed told Nevin about sexual harassment, but Nevin denies this. 30 October: Norvill testifies. She says the cast of senior actors and friends of Rush were \u201ccomplicit\u201d in endorsing his behaviour, and \u201cpressured\u201d her to put up with it. She says there was a \u201cdaily\u201d pattern of \u201csexual harassment\u201d from Rush that made her feel \u201cbelittled\u201d and \u201ctrapped\u201d. \u201cI was at the bottom of the rung in terms of hierarchy and Geoffrey was definitely at the top,\u201d she says. \u201cI was looking at a room that was complicit, my director didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it, so I felt quashed in terms of my ability to find allies.\u201d 1 November: Mark Leonard Winter, a fellow cast member in King Lear, says he saw Rush cup Norvill\u2019s breast. \u201cI saw Geoffrey\u2019s hand cupping around the bottom of EJ\u2019s breast, which was something I hadn\u2019t seen before on stage,\u201d he says. 2-6 November: The Witness X saga.

Rush brings in a third barrister \u2013 Kieran Smark SC \u2013 to oppose Witness X\u2019s evidence being allowed. Four days later, Wigney says Witness X is not allowed, because the allegations had nothing to do with the 2016 King Lear production. 8 November: The final day of the trial. Wigney starts work on the decision. What kinds of ruling could the judge make? Without predicting who wins the case, there are a range of different rulings the judge could make. When someone sues for defamation, they have to lay out what the particular negative imputations are that they are fighting. As we\u2019ve seen, in this case Rush says the article implied he was \u201ca pervert\u201d, \u201ca sexual predator\u201d and committed sexual assault during the production. There are three questions that the judge has to ask. The first is whether these imputations were in fact conveyed by the article. The Daily Telegraph denies that its article\u2019s words and photo even conveyed that Rush was \u201ca pervert\u201d and similar. Wigney must look at each imputation and decide whether it was conveyed (in the mind of the \u201cordinary, reasonable reader\u201d). It\u2019s not technically a legal defence \u2013 but the Telegraph will win if Wigney rules that none of the imputations were conveyed. The second question is whether the imputations, if conveyed, are defamatory \u2013 that is, if they will they damage Rush\u2019s reputation. This will likely not be an issue, as the Telegraph has admitted that if conveyed, the allegations are clearly defamatory. Finally, if the above are conveyed, the last decision is whether the Daily Telegraph has a defence \u2013 namely the truth defence. According to the legislation, something does not need to be wholly true, but rather \u201csubstantially true\u201d. The bar is set as \u201con the balance of probabilities\u201d \u2013 lower than the bar in criminal trials of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. It\u2019s important to note that each imputation can be ruled on separately. For example, it\u2019s possible that the truth defence will be approved for the imputation that Rush is \u201ca pervert\u201d, but not that he \u201ccommitted sexual assault\u201d. This means Rush would be paid out damages for some of the imputations, but not all of them. Could there be an appeal? No matter what happens, an appeal is very likely over the costs \u2013 coming from either party. Both parties could also appeal over the verdict \u2013 but only if they believe the judge made an error of law, not of fact. An example of an error of law is if the judge misinterpreted how the defence of truth worked, and gave it a higher bar for proof than it should have had.",
