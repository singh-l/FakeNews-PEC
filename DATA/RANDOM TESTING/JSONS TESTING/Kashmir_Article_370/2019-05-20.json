Being a positive flag-bearer for British Asians and, in particular, Muslims, during what feel like fractious times is something Moeen has never once shunned.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Times are changing. Parents are seeing cricket as a proper career now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI know my responsibilities. They are to my religion, my parents, my wife, my family and my community. People make mistakes along the way. Cricket means I may not always be there for everyone all the time. But when I take the field for my country, I know there are a lot of people I am representing.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just when I\u2019m playing in England but overseas, too. When I go abroad I\u2019m representing England but also the British Asians \u2013 or whatever people want to call us \u2013 and I know people look up to me. It\u2019s not something I always dwell on or like all the time but I know where I stand with it all.\u201d</p> <p>He may have swapped Warwickshire for Worcestershire 13 years ago, played 58 Tests and 121 white-ball internationals and now counts the world\u2019s most famous cricketer, Virat Kohli, among his friends, but Moeen has never moved away from South Birmingham.</p> <p>Indeed for all the trappings that come with being an England and Indian Premier League star, he is among the most grounded you could wish to meet. His streets remain the same, his local gym is the budget one in nearby Kings Heath where his cousins hang out; you might even spot him buzzing around the area in an old Volkswagen Polo (if the keys weren\u2019t missing at present).</p> <p>\u201cI have always wanted to stay close to my roots,\u201d Moeen explains. \u201cI always said if I played for England I\u2019d never want to change. I mean, everyone changes a bit as they get older but I will never change who I am deep down.</p> <p>\u201cThey have dropped in numbers a bit but I do catch the kids still playing [at Stoney Lane] and see my younger self in them. Last night at prayers I bumped into a guy I played with every day as a kid but hadn\u2019t seen for years. We spoke about the old days for an hour. It was great.\u201d</p> <p>Moeen remembers a good number of such park players who have drifted out of cricket, a small symptom of the wider malaise that has led to British Asians making up between 30% and 40% of the recreational game but just 4% at the professional men\u2019s level. This summer, he hopes, could be the spark to ignite this largely untapped resource.</p> <p>\u201cI was so fortunate to play my club cricket at Moseley Ashfield. We had loads of Asians, white players, black players. You grow up from that knowing it just doesn\u2019t matter what religion or culture people are into, everyone is different. We\u2019re all human beings. It\u2019s the same at Worcestershire and with England. We all just want to play cricket. That is the power of sport and cricket.</p> <p>\u201cGrowing up and playing for different teams there were times when you felt, as an Asian player, you needed to be 10 times better to stand out. You\u2019d have stereotypes thrown around \u2013 that we were lazy, ate the wrong food, didn\u2019t do fitness or work on fielding.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7cefad680e0ea7ed9ede79900f4cede4f38066d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cefad680e0ea7ed9ede79900f4cede4f38066d5/105_295_4357_2615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moeen Ali, on his bond with Adil Rashid: \u2018It sounds strange but genuinely I feel me and him, our careers coming together, was meant to be.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut it does cut the other way, too. I do believe Asian players in the past may have given up quicker. They might use the excuses on offer or say they are focusing on education when, in reality, they weren\u2019t willing to do that hard bit, that final bit which sees you break through.</p> <p>\u201cBecause my dad had that drive and passion, we never saw hard work as an obstacle. One of the most talented all-rounders I have ever came across growing up wasn\u2019t supported by his parents like I was and I think that was the difference why only one of us made it.</p> <p>\u201cBut times are changing. Parents are seeing cricket as a proper career now. You\u2019re starting to see the odd British Asian footballer coming through, too.\u201d</p> <p>In terms of demonstrating cricket as a viable path to players of a similar background, the adage goes that you can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see. And thanks to Adil Rashid\u2019s similar centrality to England\u2019s one-day side \u2013 no bowler has taken more than the Yorkshireman\u2019s 129 ODI wickets since the last World Cup \u2013 Moeen at least has not just a teammate with whom to share this responsibility, but a brother.</p> <p>Their stars have certainly aligned in this England one-day team. As well as being a potentially devastating bat at No 7, Moeen hurries through with the ball, pinching wickets and keeping it tight while Rashid attacks via his variations. The pair are inseparable on England duty. Their friendship was forged when, playing age-group cricket in their teens, they found common ground through heritage \u2013 both families originate from the Pakistani Kashmir \u2013 and religion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have seen people in dressing rooms close to tears because of what people say about them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange how our careers have run in parallel before being reunited with England,\u201d says Moeen. \u201cWe complement each other, too: he\u2019s a leg-spinner, I\u2019m an offie, he bats right-hand, me left. I truly see him as my younger brother and, as I\u2019m a year older, he shows me that respect. That\u2019s part of our culture.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a time around 2009 when he first broke into the England team and I joke that he got big for his boots and wouldn\u2019t speak to me. But really we are as tight as you\u2019ll get. It sounds strange but genuinely I feel me and him, our careers coming together, was meant to be.\u201d</p> <p>While it is a slight shame for the message they can spread that the pair closed their social media accounts last year, it is also their choice to make and refreshing in many ways. For Moeen it was chiefly to cut down on screen time and take in more of his surroundings, not least an attention-craving son. But he feels the medium can be damaging to self-esteem if not seen for what it is.</p> <p>\u201cThere is so much negativity on there,\u201d says Moeen. \u201cDo something good, there will still always be that person who is negative. It doesn\u2019t matter in reality but some take it personally. I have seen people in dressing rooms close to tears because of what people say about them.\u201d</p> <p>By polarising and amplifying public discourse, social media is, in his eyes, a cause of many wider ills too. Extremism is something Moeen rejects in any form, a topic we briefly touch upon when discussing the Easter Sunday bombings of the Shangri-La and Cinnamon Grand in Colombo, two hotels where we stayed during England\u2019s tour to Sri Lanka last year.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who looked after us at the hotel [Shangri-La] were so nice. It was so shocking. I had my wife and son in that breakfast room [where one of the explosions took place]. It\u2019s all such a waste and such a blow to humanity. What has happened to us? There\u2019s so much hate in the world. People just want to get on with their lives and be happy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/19/jofra-acher-england-bowling-cricket\">\u2018Jofra\u2019s a genius\u2019 \u2013 the lowdown on what makes Archer different</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a message of peace that Moeen takes into his cricket too, and as we finally look to the Ashes series this summer he expresses concern for Steve Smith and David Warner.
