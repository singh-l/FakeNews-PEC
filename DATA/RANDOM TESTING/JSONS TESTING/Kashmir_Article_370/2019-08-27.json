China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The revocation of special status from the state of Jammu and Kashmir has stripped it of any autonomy, removing its constitution and rules that have prevented outsiders from buying land. Many Kashmiris fear the change will alter the demographic and traditions of the territory, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state.</p> \n<p>Despite heavy security, sporadic protests have continued over the past two weeks.

It is not known why he was detained.<br><br>\u201cHis cousin was with him and he came running to us. We rushed outside and tried to resist but the policemen cocked their guns and pointed them at us,\u201d said Aamina. She was assigned the number 56 by prison staff and asked to wait for her chance to enter the jail. She carried a small lunch box with food for her son.</p> \n<p>Sarwar left her home in north Kashmir\u2019s Hathlong village at dawn in the hope of visiting her son, Aqib. She said he was detained in a midnight raid eight days ago. She said no reason was provided for his arrest.</p> \n<p>\u201cMay God\u2019s wrath fall on them! My son was innocent, trust me he has done nothing,\u201d she said. Her neighbour, Fareeda, had also travelled to meet her son, Bilal, who was detained along with Aqib.</p> \n<p>Families waited for hours to see their relatives. \u201cHe said nothing. He only cried,\u201d Fareeda said afterwards, breaking into tears. On her arm, a stamp read \u201costrich\u201d and \u201ccrocodile\u201d \u2013 a code that is changed daily that allows entry into the jail.</p> \n<p>According to estimates collected separately by Associated Press and Agence France-Presse, between 2,300 and 4,000 people have been detained.

      "bodyText": "There was only one knock at the door before police officers entered Tanveer Sheikh\u2019s home. Armed men climbed through the windows and began searching room to room, asking for Tanveer. \u201cWe have young girls at home and they were woken from sleep,\u201d said Maryam, Tanveer\u2019s mother. \u201cI told the policemen, how could they barge in like this? We could have been naked.\u201d Tanveer, who is 16 or 17 years old, according to the family, was not at home in Srinagar, in Indian-administered Kashmir, at the time, so officers took his uncle Naseer instead. The police did not explain why they wanted to detain Tanveer. \u201cThey said: \u2018You hand over Tanveer and we will let Naseer go,\u2019\u201d said Maryam. Naseer\u2019s son keeps asking for his father, who has been held for 11 days. \u201cHe is two years old,\u201d Maryam said. \u201cWhat will we tell him? He will not even understand what has happened.\u201d Naseer is among thousands of people reportedly detained by police as part of a major crackdown launched after the Indian government revoked the region\u2019s special status three week\u2019s ago. Prominent politicians, including former chief ministers, are understood to be among the detained, as well as business owners and lawyers. Most of those arrested are young men. According to local media reports, some prisoners have been flown out of Kashmir to prisons in Lucknow, Bareilly and Agra. It is possible that people are being held under the Public Safety Act, a controversial law that allows authorities to imprison someone for up to two years without charge or trial. UN human rights experts said last week they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u2019\u201d by the developments. Groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also expressed alarm. A communications blackout, which has lasted more than three weeks, has severely hampered work by activists to document potential human rights abuses. The suspension of phone and internet services has also left relatives unable to call one another. The revocation of special status from the state of Jammu and Kashmir has stripped it of any autonomy, removing its constitution and rules that have prevented outsiders from buying land. Many Kashmiris fear the change will alter the demographic and traditions of the territory, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. Despite heavy security, sporadic protests have continued over the past two weeks. A sympathiser of a banned political group, who asked not to be named, told the Guardian last week the region was a \u201cburning volcano\u201d that would \u201cerupt any time\u201d. Delhi\u2019s actions have also escalated tensions with Pakistan, which claims Kashmir and has suggested India could carry out ethnic cleansing. Outside Srinagar\u2019s central jail, families from across Kashmir queued to visit their loved ones. Aamina said her 22-year-old son, Junaid Nabi Wani, was arrested after Friday prayers two weeks ago. \u201cHe was sitting on the roadside with neighbours and relatives when police came and asked for his identity card,\u201d Aamina said. A police officer then placed his arm around Wani\u2019s shoulder and asked him to take a walk. An armoured vehicle was waiting, she said, and he was bundled into it and taken away. It is not known why he was detained. \u201cHis cousin was with him and he came running to us. We rushed outside and tried to resist but the policemen cocked their guns and pointed them at us,\u201d said Aamina. She was assigned the number 56 by prison staff and asked to wait for her chance to enter the jail. She carried a small lunch box with food for her son. Sarwar left her home in north Kashmir\u2019s Hathlong village at dawn in the hope of visiting her son, Aqib. She said he was detained in a midnight raid eight days ago. She said no reason was provided for his arrest. \u201cMay God\u2019s wrath fall on them! My son was innocent, trust me he has done nothing,\u201d she said. Her neighbour, Fareeda, had also travelled to meet her son, Bilal, who was detained along with Aqib. Families waited for hours to see their relatives. \u201cHe said nothing. He only cried,\u201d Fareeda said afterwards, breaking into tears. On her arm, a stamp read \u201costrich\u201d and \u201ccrocodile\u201d \u2013 a code that is changed daily that allows entry into the jail. According to estimates collected separately by Associated Press and Agence France-Presse, between 2,300 and 4,000 people have been detained. Officials said recently there had been \u201ca few\u201d detentions, to prevent disorder. Amnesty International accused the Indian government of \u201cdeliberate silencing of voices in the region\u201d. Naseer\u2019s family say he is being held to ransom until his nephew is handed over. Such arrests are common, according to several families in Srinagar\u2019s old city, traditionally a flashpoint for anti-India protests. A family in the Gojwara locality said police raided their home at midnight on 8 August and asked for their 25-year-old son. \u201cHe was not at home, so they detained his father. He is 70 years old,\u201d the family said. They asked to remain anonymous because their daughters had not been informed. \u201cWhen they [daughters] come, we tell them their father has gone out for a walk. When some time passes, we tell them to leave and go home early,\u201d a family member said. \u201cThe police ask us to bring our son and take the father back,\u201d they added. Amnesty International India has previously documented cases where fathers were asked to bring another son for detention if they wanted their first son to be released. \u201cThese detentions are not just unlawful but also lead to harassment and intimidation of the families,\u201d said Mrinal Sharma, a policy adviser for the rights group. Meenakshi Ganguly, the south Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said detainees must be allowed access to proper legal counsel and families should be told where relatives were being held. \u201cInternational law prohibits indefinite detentions and all those in custody should be swiftly released or charged,\u201d she said. Aamina said she was scared to be at home and had barely slept since her son was taken. \u201cI promise if he is released I will leave this place. I will beg but I will go somewhere where no one knows us,\u201d she said. Her husband died last year and her other son has spent two years in prison. \u201cI am all alone now,\u201d she said. \u201cA storm has hit my life.\u201d",
