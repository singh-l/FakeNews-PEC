On Saturday, the team was playing Goa FC at Kalyani stadium outside Kolkata for an important match but he didn\u2019t call his mother. Or rather, he couldn\u2019t. \u201cBecause of the communications lockdown, I couldn\u2019t call her for the prayer. Like everyone else, she is caged inside her home.
