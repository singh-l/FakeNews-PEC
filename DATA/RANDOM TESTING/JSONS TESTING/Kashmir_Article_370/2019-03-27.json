In a stirring intervention on Wednesday, the European council president praised those who marched on the streets of London and the millions who are petitioning the government to revoke article 50. Speaking to the European parliament, Tusk reprimanded those who voiced concerns about a potential lengthy extension to article 50 in the event of the Commons rejecting the withdrawal agreement again this week. Tusk said: \u201cLet me make one personal remark to the members of this parliament. Before the European council, I said that we should be open to a long extension if the UK wishes to rethink its Brexit strategy, which would of course mean the UK\u2019s participation in the European parliament elections.

That proposal, put forward by the former Labour cabinet minister Margaret Beckett, lost by 27 votes on Wednesday evening, the second smallest loss among the eight solutions to the Brexit impasse, offering some hope to campaigners in future votes to come. But EU sources said they were concerned that the UK parliament was still unable to coalesce around a solution, saying: \u201cOur interlocutor remains the British government.\u201d The Guardian revealed on Wednesday morning that the EU has pencilled in April Fools\u2019 Day 2020 as a first day for the UK outside the bloc since 1973 if May fails to ratify her deal but seeks a long extension of article 50 on the basis that a new plan has emerged. The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage responded to Tusk by describing him as \u201cdeluded\u201d and claiming that a second referendum would deliver a larger majority for leave. In a pantomime moment, Farage turned to those sat behind him to ask whether they really wanted him to return as an MEP.

Tusk\u2019s comments came as the British government emailed the 5.8 million people who have signed a UK parliament petition seeking the revocation of article 50. The email informed signatories that \u201cthis government will not revoke article 50\u201d. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, speaking after Tusk on the subject of Tuesday\u2019s summit, told MEPs he awaited the Commons decision with interest. \u201cThe debate on China was far less complicated than the debate on the UK and I was saying to some of you that if I was to compare Great Britain to a sphinx, the sphinx would be an open book by comparison,\u201d Juncker said. \u201cLet\u2019s see how that book speaks over the next week or so.\u201d Barnier warned the British government that the Irish backstop, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the single market and the customs union, would continue to form the basis of the EU\u2019s policy to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "The British government has rejected a petition calling for Brexit to be stopped, which gathered more than 5.8 million signatures. The petition is due to be debated by MPs on 1 April, after breaking the 100,000 threshold for consideration and becoming the best-supported proposal in the history of the House of Commons and government\u2019s e-petitions website. Rejecting the oft-repeated claim that EU withdrawal is the \u201cwill of the people\u201d, it calls for the revocation of the Article 50 letter informing the European Council of the UK\u2019s intention to leave. The Article 50 letter can be withdrawn by the UK unilaterally, without the need for EU agreement, leaving Britain free to continue as a member on its current terms. But in its official response to the petition, the department for exiting the EU said: \u201cIt remains the Government\u2019s firm policy not to revoke Article 50. We will honour the outcome of the 2016 referendum and work to deliver an exit which benefits everyone, whether they voted to Leave or to Remain. \u201cRevoking Article 50, and thereby remaining in the European Union, would undermine both our democracy and the trust that millions of voters have placed in government.\u201d The department said while it acknowledged the \u201cconsiderable number\u201d of people who had signed the petition, the government had written to every household prior to the 2016 referendum promising the outcome of the referendum would be implemented and people voted with that understanding. \u201c17.4 million people then voted to leave the European Union, providing the biggest democratic mandate for any course of action ever directed at UK government,\u201d said the department\u2019s statement. The department added that 80% of those who voted in the 2017 general election voted for parties who committed in their manifestos to uphold the referendum result. \u201cRevoking Article 50 would break the promises made by Government to the British people, disrespect the clear instruction from a democratic vote, and in turn, reduce confidence in our democracy. \u201cAs the Prime Minister has said, failing to deliver Brexit would cause \u2018potentially irreparable damage to public trust\u2019, and it is imperative that people can trust their Government to respect their votes and deliver the best outcome for them.\u201d The petition will be debated by MPs in the Commons\u2019 secondary chamber Westminster Hall. A Government minister will be required to respond to the petition, but there will be no vote on the action it demands. The woman behind the petition, Margaret Georgiadou, said on Saturday she had received death threats. She also said she had deleted her Facebook account after receiving a \u201ctorrent of abuse\u201d. MPs will also debate a petition calling for a second EU referendum, which has received more than 120,000 signatures, and another - signed by more than 140,000 - demanding that the UK leave with or without a deal on 29 March.",
