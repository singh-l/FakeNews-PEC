      "body": "<p>John Harris suggests that obliging elite universities to admit no more than 7% of their students from private schools would obviate the need to abolish these socially and culturally damaging institutions (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/bitain-brexit-crisis-public-schools\" title=\"\">Britain\u2019s crisis is rooted in the power of our public schools</a>, 18 March). This argument assumes that the ability of the most prestigious of these schools to promote their pupils into elite positions in society is based upon the quality of the education they offer when, in fact, their power is essentially social and derives from the kind of pupils who go there in the first place. A landmark research project, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-dogged-persistence-of-the-old-boy/\" title=\"\">carried out by Reeves and Friedman at the LSE in 2017</a>, showed quite conclusively that pupils attending one of the nine original \u201cpublic\u201d schools handed over to the rich by the Clarendon Commission of 1861 are overwhelmingly more likely to join the ruling elite than pupils of other schools, whether private or state, quite regardless of their academic achievements. The quality of education offered by these schools is beside the point.</p> <p>Also, the 7% who attend private schools account for around 30% of A-level grades, chiefly because most private schools are academically selective, so any ceiling set upon the numbers admitted to elite universities from private schools should be set at 30% rather than 7%. Many Oxbridge colleges already admit 70% or more of their students from state schools and it is high time that all of them were required to do so, but Harris is naive if he thinks that this would seriously challenge the power of our ruling elite. The most effective means to tackle the problem is to follow the example of the Finns and make it illegal for any school to charge fees. Such a policy could see the best private schools incorporated into the state system, while schools which offer little beyond straw boaters and nicely piped blazers would just disappear.<br><strong>Michael Pyke</strong><br><em>Campaign for State Education</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is correct in his analysis. However, the negative influence spreads far wider.</p> <p>I spent almost 40 years at a fairly senior level in the civil service and witnessed firsthand this British phenomenon. People so lacking in self-awareness that they were unable to admit failings yet were promoted way beyond their ability. Catastrophic mistakes and errors rewarded with further promotion and bonuses and an inability to understand the needs of the public they served. All of this exhibited by the private-school-educated, who seemed to live a charmed life untroubled by the realities of life affecting the rest of us.

      "bodyText": "When he started out as a young civil servant, said Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, a German MP from the liberal Free Democratic party, Britain was \u201calways held up as a model of good diplomacy, of pragmatism and of self-restraint\u201d. That was then. Now, with the UK\u2019s scheduled exit barely a week away and still no clarity in sight, \u201cNo one would sign up to that view,\u201d Lambsdorff said. \u201cNow, the UK is seen as neither pragmatic, self-restrained, nor a model.\u201d For politicians, diplomats and officials across the continent, the past two-and-a-half years of Britain\u2019s fraught, seemingly interminable and increasingly shambolic departure from the EU have proved an eye-opener. Some have responded with humour. Nathalie Loiseau, France\u2019s Europe minister, said recently that if she had one, she would call her cat Brexit: \u201cIt wakes me up miaowing because it wants to go out. When I open the door, its sits there, undecided. Then it looks daggers at me when I put it out.\u201d Others have found it harder to laugh. To the shock of many, Brexit has revealed a country they long looked up to locked in a narrative of its own exceptionalism, talking mainly to itself, incoherent, entitled, incapable of compromise (with itself or its neighbours), wholly unrealistic, and startlingly ignorant of the workings of an organisation it has belonged to for nearly 50 years. \u201cBritain\u2019s reputation is, there\u2019s no denying it, much diminished,\u201d judged Pascal Lamy, one of France\u2019s most senior public officials, a former presidential adviser, European commissioner and World Trade Organization head. Some British politicians are \u201con another planet\u201d, Lamy said, incapable of seeing that Brexit is the infinitely complex diplomatic and legal equivalent of \u201ctrying to take the eggs out of an omelette. Even today, they spout the most monstrous nonsense. Many have still not landed in a place one could call reality. The cognitive dissonance is \u2026 remarkable.\u201d Andr\u00e9 Gattolin, vice president of the French senate\u2019s European affairs committee, concurred. \u201cIt\u2019s actually pathetic, and distressing for someone like me who has liked and admired Britain all his life, to watch these debates in Westminster,\u201d Gattolin said. \u201cMPs are suggesting solutions, possibilities, that just do not exist in the real world.\u201d The Brexit process feels like \u201csome weird mix of Anarchy in the UK and one of those Agatha Christie detective stories where all the suspects are locked in a room talking to each other, with no interest in, or grasp of, what\u2019s going on outside,\u201d he said. In practical negotiating terms, \u201cefficient and knowledgeable\u201d officials had been short-circuited, Lamy said, \u201ccut out of both the decision-making and the action, replaced by people who are ideologically pure \u2013 and, of course, have royally messed things up\u201d. From the outset, recalled Tom\u00e1\u0161 Prouza, the Czech Republic\u2019s then state secretary for EU affairs, British unpreparedness was clear. \u201cEven before the referendum, when David Cameron met [the then Czech prime minister] Bohuslav Sobotka, I saw a very serious lack of preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cSobotka was a very technical person, interested in how to re-open treaties. Cameron had a complete lack of interest in the subject.\u201d Worse followed: \u201cWe had meetings with David Davis when he had no idea what he was talking about. No idea of how EU treaties functioned.\u201d Most damaging of all, Prouza said, was Britain\u2019s \u201csense of entitlement \u2026 It was all: \u2018We are the UK, we are the big guys. You need us for business, in terms of security, you export so much to the British market.\u2019\u201d The result? \u201cWe always looked up to Britain as an example of how a country could be ideally run. All that has gone up in flames.\u201d Han ten Broeke, until last year an MP specialising in EU affairs who chaired the Dutch-UK parliamentary friendship group, agreed. \u201cLike many, I\u2019ve long been an admirer,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have to say I\u2019ve been completely baffled by this lack of understanding in the UK.\u201d From the first hour, Brexiters painted \u201ca wholly unrealistic picture. The belief that \u2018WTO rules\u2019 will save you, if sovereignty is shared it\u2019s somehow not real \u2026 These are fundamental misunderstandings.\u201d Britain should know, he said, that \u201cfrom our perspective, it looks like you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting out of \u2013 let alone what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d Alexandre Holroyd, a member of the French parliament\u2019s European affairs committee and Franco-British friendship group, said Brexit had laid bare \u201chow little real understanding there is, even in a national parliament, of how the EU works, of its rules and institutions\u201d. That might not be unique to the UK, Holroyd said. But as a country that had always adopted \u201ca legal, rules-based approach to the EU\u201d, how could Britain ever have imagined that member states and allies \u201cwith essentially the same approach wouldn\u2019t maintain it when it came to the UK\u2019s demands\u201d? Sandro Gozi, an MP from Italy\u2019s centre-left Democratic party and former European affairs minister, said he was \u201csurprised to see such improvisation from a British government on such a vital topic\u201d, but that Brexiters had \u201cpresented the British people with a wide, straight, flat path \u2013 and are now on a very difficult mountain full of curves and uncertainty\u201d. The opacity of Britain\u2019s Brexit blinkers has been compounded by an adversarial UK political system that defies compromise, many said, preventing the government from ever arriving at a settled view of what Brexit should mean and tying its hands in talks. \u201cWhen the Danes voted against the Maastricht treaty, the no campaign knew exactly what it wanted afterwards,\u201d said Lykke Friis, a former Danish climate and energy minister who likened Brexit to \u201can endless roller-coaster impossible to get off\u201d. That clear vision \u201chelped serve as a basis for the national compromise that the country worked hard on, and eventually reached, afterwards,\u201d Friis said. \u201cSadly, it seems Britain doesn\u2019t really do compromise.\u201d She was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the face of a country she knew as \u201cstrategic, pragmatic, able to defend its interests\u201d, she said.

James McGrory, the director of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, said it was the \u201cbiggest mass movement in the country\u201d and hundreds of thousands were expected to join the march from Park Lane to Parliament Square. The campaign group claimed the number of coaches booked was more than double the number in October, although the exact figure is understood to be slightly less as 105 coaches brought people to the capital last autumn. Details emerged at a People\u2019s Vote event aimed largely at foreign journalists, where the campaign admitted that despite the preparations for the weekend, there was still no immediate prospect of MPs voting for a second referendum. Protesters would come from places that voted heavily to leave the EU, McGrory said, including from Chesterfield, Doncaster, Lincoln and Peterborough. A coach from the Scottish Highlands will leave on Friday evening, and another from Penzance in Cornwall will leave at 3.15am. The claim of 700,000 attendees in October made it the second largest march in the UK this century, after the 2003 Stop the War demonstration, although other estimates suggested the figure was about 450,000. McGrory and other People\u2019s Vote insiders declined to predict how many would turn up on Saturday, warning the weather would be a determining factor, but the numbers of people pre-registering on the campaign website were \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than before. Alastair Campbell, the former Labour press chief and People\u2019s Vote campaigner, conceded that despite the current Brexit crisis, \u201cif there was a vote [in the Commons] tomorrow on a people\u2019s vote it would not win\u201d. Last week, when a second referendum was put before the Commons it was voted down 334 to 85, with the majority of the Labour party abstaining and the People\u2019s Vote campaign arguing it was not the right time to press the issue to the vote. Campbell said the decision to abstain was a \u201ctactical judgment\u201d, reflecting the fact the proposal was not likely to pass even with Labour support. The march is due to begin at noon at the north end of Park Lane near Marble Arch and end at Parliament Square, with speeches from 2.45pm. Speakers from all parties are due to be announced shortly.

      "bodyText": "One thousand days since the referendum and nine to the UK\u2019s formal departure date and the EU does not yet know how, when or even if the UK will leave the union. The mood in Brussels and national capitals remains focused, but there is growing impatience with Theresa May and her government. Even those member states that are traditionally friendly towards the UK have toughened their stance. The overwhelming view is that the ball remains firmly in London\u2019s court and that it has to find a way through the turmoil. Today the union will be asked for an extension of article 50 by London. Seen against the backdrop of political and constitutional chaos in the UK, the request poses enormous dilemmas for Brussels. There is widespread concern that the Brexit virus will spread to infect the normal day-to-day business of the union \u2013 something that has been avoided up to now. From the outset, the EU prioritised an orderly UK withdrawal to minimise damage to Europe\u2019s member states, citizens and companies. For this reason the prospect of a disorderly, no-deal Brexit will weigh heavily on leaders when they meet on Thursday to discuss the issue. It is their decision, because this is Chefsache \u2013 German for a matter for the bosses. Receiving such a request just one day before a European council does not fill May\u2019s counterparts with confidence. President Tusk is visiting capitals to gauge the temperature, while the chief negotiator for the EU27, Michel Barnier, made a speech on the likely conditions for an extension. This was an exercise in signalling to London the considerations that would influence the union\u2019s decision. The key message from Barnier was a demand for greater clarity, concrete plans and a strategy, not just further can-kicking. The member states want a clear sense of how the withdrawal agreement will be passed by the House of Commons. The question of whether to grant an extension involves a series of interrelated choices; to grant one or not; and if yes, under what conditions and for how long. Given the volatility of the situation in London, all options carry great risk. Although the UK\u2019s extension request has not been formerly received yet, No 10 has announced that the prime minister will not seek a long extension. A short extension may mean until the date of European parliament elections, or at the latest until just before the new parliament meets on 2 July. On the face of it, this may be attractive to Brussels as it fudges the issue of the parliamentary elections. However, as Barnier indicated in his statement on Tuesday, the EU leaders will carefully analyse whether an extension increases the chances that the House of Commons will agree the withdrawal agreement. A short extension, paradoxically, increases the danger of a no-deal Brexit, as it enables the hard Brexiteers to run down the clock, offers no incentive to the Labour party to opt for a cross-party approach, and allows no time for an alternative political strategy or process to emerge in the UK. Its only merit is that it prevents a no-deal Brexit on 29 March and offers the prime minister a further opportunity to put the agreement to the House of Commons.

      "bodyText": "Jean-Claude Juncker has raised the prospect of an emergency summit of EU leaders next week to decide on a Brexit delay, blaming ongoing chaos in Theresa May\u2019s cabinet. The European commission president said a letter from May requesting an extension to article 50, delaying the UK\u2019s exit beyond 29 March, had not arrived overnight as expected. The 27 EU heads of state and government had expected to discuss the terms of request and come to a unanimous agreement on their response at a summit starting on Thursday in Brussels. But after a stormy cabinet meeting on Tuesday, a letter from Downing Street was not received by Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, who convenes the leaders\u2019 summits. Juncker said it appeared the British cabinet could not agree on the content of the correspondence. \u201cMy impression is ... that this week at the European council there will be no decision, but that we will probably have to meet again next week, because Mrs May doesn\u2019t have agreement to anything, either in her cabinet or in parliament.

A few hours later in the Belgian capital, Theresa May will appeal to the EU\u2019s heads of state and government to accept her expected request for a three-month delay to Brexit. Corbyn is also attending a meeting of fellow socialist opposition leaders and prime ministers, such as Spain\u2019s, Pedro Sanchez, which is taking place in Brussels in the morning. The appearance of Corbyn in Brussels at what Barnier told reporters on Tuesday evening was a \u201cvery, very sensitive\u201d time will be cause of concern in Downing Street. There will be fears that EU leaders will receive mixed messages as they mull over the prime minister\u2019s formal proposal to prolong the article 50 negotiating period. A delay will require unanimous approval by the EU\u2019s leaders. The meeting will give Corbyn an opportunity to discuss again the outline of his vision for Brexit, and update Barnier on the cross-party talks. The EU has been pushing May to shift her red lines and sign up to permanent customs union in order to garner Labour support for her deal. Barnier will is also likely to be interested in the suggestion that Labour could abstain on another vote on the deal to allow it pass on the basis that there would then be a confirmatory referendum. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens had urged Corbyn during a cross-party meeting on Tuesday to throw his weight behind a second Brexit referendum. Speaking on Tuesday evening, Barnier had said that if May could not get her current deal past parliament, the EU would be open to a long extension but only if Downing Street changed tack or there was a \u201cnew event\u201d such as a general election or second referendum. \u201cI recall this political declaration, which sets out the framework of our future relations, could be made more ambitious in the coming days if a majority in the House of Commons so wishes,\u201d Barnier said. \u201cIf not, what would be the purpose and outcome of an extension?

      "bodyText": "Theresa May will be forced to write to EU leaders on Wednesday and beg them to delay Brexit, with her cabinet deadlocked over the best way out of what Downing Street now concedes is a \u201ccrisis\u201d. The government had maintained until the last possible moment that Brexit could go ahead as planned on 29 March or after a brief \u201ctechnical extension\u201d. But after the Speaker, John Bercow, ruled the prime minister could not put her deal to parliament unchanged for a third \u201cmeaningful vote,\u201d her spokesman conceded it was now too late to leave with a deal. He said May would write to the European council president, Donald Tusk, to ask for an extension to article 50, before EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday. He declined to say how long a delay she would request, or for what purpose, simply insisting: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wait for that letter to be published.\u201d Asked whether May agreed with the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, who described the situation after Bercow\u2019s ruling on Monday as a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d, her spokesman said: \u201cIf you were to look back at the speech the prime minister gave, just before meaningful vote two, she said that if MPs did not support meaningful vote two we would be in a crisis. Events yesterday tell you that that situation has come to pass.\u201d Ministers discussed Brexit for about 90 minutes at what several sources said was a testy cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Insiders said opinion was more or less evenly divided, between those who favoured requesting a short, three-month extension, leaving in place the prospect of a no-deal Brexit in the summer, and those who want to see a much longer delay. Several sources said ministers emerged from cabinet unclear about what May\u2019s personal position was on the best way forward. Brexit-backing ministers, including leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, protested strongly about the idea of a long extension. They intend to lobby May again in the next 24 hours in a bid to quash the idea. Leadsom even warned that she now believed her colleagues were trying to thwart Brexit: \u201cThis used to be a cabinet that would deliver Brexit, but now from what I\u2019m hearing it doesn\u2019t seem like it is,\u201d she said. May also met backbench colleagues to sound them out about the next steps, including the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is widely regarded as the potential frontrunner in a leadership contest should the prime minister step aside. One cabinet source said: \u201cThe current position is untenable; if they just accept a long extension the party will split.\u201d Some members of the backbench European Research Group (ERG) at their regular meeting in Westminster on Tuesday nightopenly called for the prime minister to step aside. However, several leave-supporting MPs said they had been reassured that May\u2019s intention was still to push ahead with Brexit as rapidly as possible and that she would only accept a longer extension if forced into it by Brussels. The EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, hinted on Tuesday that Brussels would demand a clear answer to the question of how the government intended to proceed as the quid pro quo for granting an extension. \u201cThe key questions will be: does an extension increase the chances of the ratification of the withdrawal agreement? Will the UK request an extension because it wants a bit more time to rework the political declaration?\u201d Barnier said. \u201cIf not, what would be the purpose and outcome of an extension? And how can we ensure that at the end of a possible extension we are not back at the same situation as we are today?\u201d Any extension would have to be approved by a vote in both houses of parliament next week because the 29 March date is written into the EU Withdrawal Act. Ministers have promised that parliament will have the opportunity to debate how it could decide on an alternative approach next Monday, but May\u2019s spokesman insisted her priority was to continue to try to win over MPs to her deal. \u201cThe prime minister has set out that she believes that the deal she has secured from the EU is a good one, and that it is the best deal available, and she continues to work on finding a way for parliament to pass that deal, so that we can get on with leaving the EU as quickly as possible,\u201d the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. Negotiations with the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) have continued since the weekend in the hope that if its leaders signal support for her approach, key Brexiters including Jacob Rees-Mogg could swing their weight behind it. One strand of the talks has involved Philip Hammond discussing post-Brexit options for taxing goods crossing the Irish border. \u201cThe chancellor is a crucial figure in all this because customs and excise comes under his remit,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the negotiations. \u201cThe problem that is being discussed is how to tax goods \u2013 where they might be taxed, away from the border or otherwise \u2013 and how that might be done\u201d. The DUP\u2019s Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Nigel Dodds have also met May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, and the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill. Discussions have centred on how Northern Irish politicians will maintain some political oversight of the backstop, the agreement to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal.",

There is no magic money tree. When money is lost in one place, it\u2019s taken away from another programme, usually one that\u2019s easier to cut. Every wasted \u00a31bn, he says, is enough to run NHS England for three days, fund 6.25m A&amp;E attendances, 1.35m day cases in hospital, or 4m ambulance attendances.</p> <p>Morse has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/01/mays-extra-cash-for-nhs-is-not-enough-says-spending-watchdog\" title=\"\">warned the government</a> that it needs to invest more in the NHS and social care, to meet the needs of an ageing population.

He sees it as vital to call this out. \u201cBeing Mr Tactful won\u2019t change things,\u201d he says. Last year, he famously had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/04/amyas-morse-auditor-general-universal-credit-letter-esther-mcvey\" title=\"\">a public run-in</a> with the then work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, after she wrongly claimed that the NAO had called for the rollout of universal credit to be accelerated. Morse wrote an open letter to McVey to \u201cclarify the facts\u201d \u2013 the first time the watchdog had released personal correspondence with a minister. \u201cSome ministers see themselves more or less as chief executives, but without the qualifications to go with that,\u201d says Morse. The result is a litany of projects that have been overoptimistic (\u201cWhen I see the words \u2018world-beating\u2019, my heart sinks\u201d), with unrealistic timescales.

It has 796 staff, only slightly fewer than the 854 it had in 2007, who also publish more than 60 value-for-money inquiries a year, most followed up with investigations by the Commons public accounts committee (PAC). Between them, the two bodies have now published hundreds of damning and scathing reports. But has it made any difference? \u201cI always liken myself to a squawking crow, squawking away, irritating people. If you squawk for long enough, it\u2019s surprisingly effective in changing people\u2019s behaviour,\u201d says Morse.

Morse has also talked to Whitehall departments and MPs. \u201cHe has to deal with the Whitehall geopolitics and fight his corner and he\u2019s very good at it,\u201d says Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC. \u201cHe\u2019s good on wider issues, which he\u2019s embraced enthusiastically.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/13/public-services-investment-brexit-austerity-philip-hammond\">Public services desperately need investment.

While his upbringing has contributed to his concern for fairness, it\u2019s his decade at the watchdog, to which he came from a senior position in consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers via the MoD, that has fuelled his rage over the wasteful ways of too many government ministers. \u201cI really realised that society belongs to us. We\u2019re all paying for it.\u201d Public money is finite, he points out. There is no magic money tree. When money is lost in one place, it\u2019s taken away from another programme, usually one that\u2019s easier to cut. Every wasted \u00a31bn, he says, is enough to run NHS England for three days, fund 6.25m A&amp;E attendances, 1.35m day cases in hospital, or 4m ambulance attendances. Morse has warned the government that it needs to invest more in the NHS and social care, to meet the needs of an ageing population. In 2016-17, the UK spent just over \u00a3170bn on health and social care \u2013 more than 10% of GDP, but less than the 11.2% of GDP Germany spent in 2015 on health alone. Despite highlighting last year that the size of the task in preparing for Brexit means \u201cpoints of failure\u201d will be inevitable, Morse says the civil service has done well since article 50 was triggered. \u201cIt was an impossible ask, and they\u2019ve tried very hard to meet it.\u201d Since 2010, ministers have steadily increased their powers within government departments, intent on driving through their own ideas, not always wisely, according to Morse. He sees it as vital to call this out. \u201cBeing Mr Tactful won\u2019t change things,\u201d he says. Last year, he famously had a public run-in with the then work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, after she wrongly claimed that the NAO had called for the rollout of universal credit to be accelerated. Morse wrote an open letter to McVey to \u201cclarify the facts\u201d \u2013 the first time the watchdog had released personal correspondence with a minister. \u201cSome ministers see themselves more or less as chief executives, but without the qualifications to go with that,\u201d says Morse. The result is a litany of projects that have been overoptimistic (\u201cWhen I see the words \u2018world-beating\u2019, my heart sinks\u201d), with unrealistic timescales. These include universal credit, the Hinkley Point nuclear power station saga, and, of course, Brexit. Every year, the NAO audits the accounts of around 370 central government departments, agencies and other public bodies. It has 796 staff, only slightly fewer than the 854 it had in 2007, who also publish more than 60 value-for-money inquiries a year, most followed up with investigations by the Commons public accounts committee (PAC). Between them, the two bodies have now published hundreds of damning and scathing reports. But has it made any difference? \u201cI always liken myself to a squawking crow, squawking away, irritating people. If you squawk for long enough, it\u2019s surprisingly effective in changing people\u2019s behaviour,\u201d says Morse. He points to the NHS, finally collaborating more closely with local social services, after a lot of NAO work on how local primary care systems interact. It\u2019s not just about publishing reports. Morse has also talked to Whitehall departments and MPs. \u201cHe has to deal with the Whitehall geopolitics and fight his corner and he\u2019s very good at it,\u201d says Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC. \u201cHe\u2019s good on wider issues, which he\u2019s embraced enthusiastically.\u201d Hillier and Morse have had a close, smooth working relationship from the start, says Morse, unlike his initial relationship with the previous PAC chair, Margaret Hodge. \u201cWe\u2019re now good friends, but initially we fought like cats and dogs,\u201d he says. Hodge agrees she was \u201creally cross\u201d with Morse at the start of his tenure over a couple of issues where she\u2019d suggested changes to existing audit arrangements \u2013 something Morse felt was a threat to his authority and that of the NAO. \u201cWe\u2019re both strong-willed and like our own way,\u201d says Hodge. \u201cBut we realised we would get much more done if we worked together.\u201d She commends Morse\u2019s bravery in speaking out. Morse says he likes working with strong women: \u201cThey\u2019re more fun than strong men. More insightful and more interested in what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d While the NAO and Morse are seen as successful, some would like to see an expanded remit. \u201cWithin the current system, the NAO has consistently been the voice to expose the failings of the current framework and has been doing this over a long cycle now,\u201d says social entrepreneur Hilary Cottam. \u201cThe question is how they can use the data and critique to begin to advocate for something new.\u201d For now, Morse leaves with good advice for all those spending public money: ask people about where they want their money spent and, above all, understand that hard choices have to be made. When big projects go wrong, they suck up money from other services. \u201cBy looking over the walls, I can see that.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 69. Lives: Suffolk and London.
