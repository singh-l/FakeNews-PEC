      "bodyText": "Delhi has formally revoked the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s constitutional autonomy and split it into two federal territories in an attempt to integrate it fully into India. The decision of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to change Kashmir\u2019s status and tighten the government\u2019s grip over the region in August has stoked anger and resentment while a three-decade armed revolt rages. At midnight on Wednesday the state was formally taken under direct federal control and split into the territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, bringing an end to decades of semi-autonomous rule. The state\u2019s constitution, as well as its penal code and state flag, was nullified, and the region is now subject to the same central laws as all other Indian territories. Jammu and Kashmir will have its own state legislature, while Ladakh will be controlled from the capital. Girish Chandra Murmu, a former bureaucrat who served Modi when he was the chief minister of Gujarat, administered the oath of Kashmir\u2019s first lieutenant governor in a ceremony held under tight security. Hasnain Masoodi, an Indian parliamentarian from south Kashmir and a former judge, said Delhi\u2019s decision to revoke the status was unilateral and a \u201cmassive assault on the identity and autonomy of the state\u201d. \u201cWe were an independent country 70 years ago, we have a history of 5,000 years and suddenly we have been reduced to a municipality,\u201d said Masoodi. \u201cEveryone has a sense of bitterness. There is a sense of injustice, disillusionment and humiliation.\u201d It was the implementation of a decision first made by Modi\u2019s government 86 days ago, when legislation was rushed through the Indian parliament to approve the end of article 370 of the constitution, which for over 70 years has guaranteed special privileges to the predominately Muslim region. It had been drawn up in 1947 as the foundation of Kashmir\u2019s agreement to be part of India. A swift annexation of Kashmir followed in August, with tens of thousands of Indian troops deployed into the region, phones and internet shut down, and politicians and public figures placed under arrest. For the past three months, the several million citizens of Kashmir have lived under severe lockdown, with their freedom to work and go to school restricted. Syed Babar, a lawyer based in Kashmir\u2019s main city Srinagar, said Kashmir\u2019s transformation into a union territory reflected \u201ca political holocaust inflicted on the people\u201d. \u201cIt is the day of political betrayal and beginning of an era where violence as an argument will have justification and takers, which is very unfortunate,\u201d he said. The Indian government justified its decision to revoke Kashmir\u2019s special status by repeatedly saying it would end militancy in the region, which had continued with varying intensity for the past three decades. In recent weeks, however, there have been several incidents of violence targeting non-local truck drivers and labourers. In the most deadly incident earlier this week, five labourers from the eastern Indian state of West Bengal were shot dead in the southern Kashmiri district of Kulgam. One of Kashmir\u2019s militant groups, the al-Qaida-inspired Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, announced a new leadership on Wednesday, less than a week after the police said they had wiped out the group after its chief was killed in a gunfight. Babar said he feared Delhi\u2019s decision would lead to a rise in radicalisation and would serve as an \u201cinvitation to foreign militants\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is no room for dialogue now.
