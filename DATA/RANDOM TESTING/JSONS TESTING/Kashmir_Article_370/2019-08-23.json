The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They began turning out long before the official 8pm start, old and young, office workers in suits standing beside students in the unofficial protest uniform of black clothes and face masks.</p> \n<p>Protesters cited the Baltic human chain as inspiration. \u201cIn that place, at that time, people tried to use this form of expression to express their wish for freedom from the Soviet state,\u201d said a protester named Kay, who declined to give her surname for fear she might be penalised at work for joining the protests.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn very similar terms, the Hong Kong people are trying to express themselves and express their yearning for freedom and basic human rights,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2cd086ff178110b2030c7e4dbd38ce4d2169ac2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2cd086ff178110b2030c7e4dbd38ce4d2169ac2/0_372_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters join hands outside the Hong Kong Space Museum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters join hands outside the Hong Kong Space Museum.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Unlike other protests that have snarled up the city, demonstrators stood in single file along pavements.

It is the first such call to be made by separatist leaders since Delhi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/india-revoke-disputed-kashmir-special-status\">stripped the region of autonomy</a> almost three weeks ago.</p> \n<p>The roads leading to the office of the UN Military Observer group, where protesters were instructed to march, were sealed off on Friday morning, with rolls of concertina wire and armoured vehicles stationed in the middle of the road.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1a6ba9a1-6cf4-4c41-97ae-7af3f3152187\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Who controls Kashmir?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/india\">India</a>&nbsp;and Pakistan came into being in 1947.</p>\n    <p>Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \u2018line of control\u2019 based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The office, located in Srinagar\u2019s Sonwar neighbourhood, was set up in 1949 after the first war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.

      "bodyText": "The main city in Indian-administered Kashmir has been placed under lockdown following calls for residents to march en masse against the revocation of the territory\u2019s special status. Posters were put up overnight this week urging people to defy a ban on public gatherings and join a march in Srinagar after Friday prayers. It is the first such call to be made by separatist leaders since Delhi stripped the region of autonomy almost three weeks ago. The roads leading to the office of the UN Military Observer group, where protesters were instructed to march, were sealed off on Friday morning, with rolls of concertina wire and armoured vehicles stationed in the middle of the road. The office, located in Srinagar\u2019s Sonwar neighbourhood, was set up in 1949 after the first war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. The territory is claimed by India and Pakistan in full and ruled in part by both. At a nearby roadblock, an elderly woman pleaded with the Indian paramilitary personnel to let her pass to go to a hospital. \u201cI am an old woman. What harm will I do?\u201d she asked in Kashmiri, a language many Indian paramilitaries do not understand. An Indian paramilitary officer manning a roadblock told the Guardian his colleagues were under strict orders to keep the area isolated. \u201cYou know which office is there. We have been ordered not to allow anyone, not even the policemen,\u201d he said. It is understood that residents will be allowed to walk to local neighbourhood mosques, but a Muslim shrine near the UN office was closed to prayergoers. The roads leading in and out of Srinagar\u2019s volatile old city, where protests are frequent and violent, were also blocked with concertina wire. In the past, protests have frequently taken place after Friday prayers. Two weeks ago at least 10,000 people reportedly took to the streets after restrictions were eased to allow residents to attend mosques. BBC footage showed security forces firing and using teargas to disperse crowds. Despite heavy security, sporadic protests have continued over the past two weeks. At least 152 people have been hurt by teargas and pellets, according to data collected by Reuters from the region\u2019s two main hospitals. The government, which has not yet provided any figures of the injured in the sporadic protests, has said there have been no deaths in this month\u2019s demonstrations. Millions of people in Kashmir have spent almost three weeks under a communications blackout with no access to phone or internet services. Landlines were restored in many areas last weekend, but mobile services remain suspended. Though travel restrictions were eased earlier this week, markets and shops across Kashmir valley remained shut. A sympathiser of a banned political group, who asked not to be named, told the Guardian this week that the region was a \u201cburning volcano\u201d. \u201cIt will erupt any time,\u201d he said. One poster distributed in Srinagar this week urged \u201cevery person, young and old, men and women\u201d to march on Friday, according to Reuters, which said the call was made by the Joint Resistance Leadership, which represents all major separatist groups. Most separatist leaders are understood to have been detained.

Many Kashmiris fear that the change will alter the demography and traditions of the territory, India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. Delhi\u2019s actions have also escalated tensions with Pakistan, which claims Kashmir and has suggested India could carry out ethnic cleansing. The US president, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly offered to mediate the matter, will raise the issue with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, this weekend when they meet on the sidelines of the G7 meeting in France, according to a senior US administration official. Trump will press Modi on how he plans to calm regional tensions after the withdrawal of Kashmir\u2019s autonomy, and stress the need for dialogue, the official said. Pakistan has long sought to internationalise the Kashmir dispute, but India has always rejected third party mediation and maintains that its recent actions in Kashmir are an internal matter.",
