The message of the songs is about bringing people together and supporting inclusivity.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, outside the school gates, a Pakistani couple who don\u2019t want to give their names, sigh and roll their eyes when asked about Afsar. \u201cThe Pakistani community back home always looks for leaders, so this is why he thinks he is <em>shahenshah</em> [a king] now,\u201d says the father. \u201cBut we are not interested. The teachers are good. School is good. No, we don\u2019t want our children taught these things and confused at a little age, but we have no choice.\u201d</p> <p>By 2020, every school will be mandated to update its relationship and sex education (RSE) lessons.
