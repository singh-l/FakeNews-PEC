But since his dismissal from office last September, the former spy chief\u2019s behaviour on social media has raised questions over his own ability to distinguish conspiracy theories from truthful reporting, and sparked a debate about the neutrality of the powerful intelligence agency during a period in which a resurgent far right marched over several days in the city of Chemnitz. On Sunday Maa\u00dfen shared on Twitter an article from a rightwing extremist blog claiming that the rescue of a group of people adrift off the Libyan coast by the rescue boat Sea-Watch 3, and the subsequent arrest of its German captain, Carola Rackete, was in fact a \u201cpiece of propaganda\u201d orchestrated by the German public broadcaster ARD. The article likens a documentary about Sea-Watch 3 by ARD\u2019s programme Panorama to the Nazi propaganda ministry embedding film crews on \u201cStrength Through Joy\u201d cruise ships, and suggests the film crew could have dragged the rescued refugees out to sea in the first place. Maa\u00dfen, who started tweeting in April, commented on the shared article with the words: \u201cShould this report be true, then Panorama is not western television\u201d \u2013 a reference to an earlier tweet in which he implied that modern German media was as censorious as that of socialist East Germany. The tweet has since been deleted, but questions over his judgment remain.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been strongly criticised for arguing Islam has caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d the west, in an essay unearthed by the Guardian. Writing about the rise of the religion in an appendix added to a later edition of The Dream of Rome, his 2006 book about the Roman empire, Johnson said there was something about Islam that hindered development in parts of the globe and, as a result, \u201cMuslim grievance\u201d was a factor in virtually every conflict. Johnson\u2019s argument was described as disconcerting and problematic by Tell Mama, which monitors anti-Muslim hate and said he had demonstrated a lack of understanding of the religion. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said many people would like to know if the favourite to become the next prime minister still believed \u201cIslam inherently inhibits the path to progress and freedom\u201d. Last year, Johnson was accused of dog-whistle politics after he used a Telegraph column to liken women wearing the burqa to \u201cletter boxes\u201d and \u201cbank robbers\u201d. In an essay titled And Then Came the Muslims, added to the 2007 edition of his book, Johnson wrote: \u201cThere must be something about Islam that indeed helps to explain why there was no rise of the bourgeoisie, no liberal capitalism and therefore no spread of democracy in the Muslim world. \u201cIt is extraordinary to think that under the Roman/Byzantine empire, the city of Constantinople kept the candle of learning alight for a thousand years, and that under Ottoman rule, the first printing press was not seen in Istanbul until the middle of the nineteenth century. Something caused them to be literally centuries behind.\u201d The Conservative leadership frontrunner wrote that the inhibitor of progress was \u201ca fatal religious conservatism\u201d and the further the Muslim world had \u201cfallen behind, the more bitterness and confusion there has been, to the point where virtually every global flashpoint you can think of \u2013 from Bosnia to Palestine to Iraq to Kashmir \u2013 involves some sense of Muslim grievance\u201d. The MCB said: \u201cWe of course are of the view that Islam has a role to play in progress and prosperity, be that in the Muslim world or here at our home in the west.\u201d Mohammed Amin, a former chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum, said Johnson\u2019s analysis risked \u201cactively promoting hatred of Muslims\u201d. Amin was expelled by the forum in June after criticising the party leadership\u2019s response to reports of Islamophobia and comparing Johnson\u2019s popularity to that of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. In the book, published after the airing of a TV series with the same name, Johnson likened the Roman empire to the EU, marvelling at the former\u2019s ability to create unity across continents. The essay was written as negotiations for Turkey to join the EU were under way and Johnson argued Ankara should be allowed to become a member, creating \u201conce again a Roman economic community\u201d and \u201creuniting the two halves of the Roman empire around the shores of the Mediterranean\u201d. He said the country\u2019s \u201cfar from perfect\u201d record on human rights was \u201cone of the most important reasons for keeping the Turks on the tram tracks to EU membership, surely, that we thereby help the progressive forces in Turkey and stop the country drifting backwards\u201d. The MCB said: \u201cMany of us would be interested to find out whether Mr Johnson still believes that Islam inherently inhibits the path to progress and freedom, and whether he still thinks Turkey should be admitted to the European Union, especially after the extraordinary and false claims made about Turkish and Muslim immigration during the Brexit campaign.\u201d During the EU referendum campaign, Johnson argued a leave vote would allow the UK to \u201cend uncontrolled immigration\u201d. He was a figurehead for the Vote Leave campaign, which issued a controversial poster claiming Turkey was joining the EU, despite talks to this end having long since stalled. In the essay, Johnson acknowledged Christianity had a history of \u201cdisgusting cruelty\u201d, writing: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that we were burning books and heretics ourselves.\u201d He added: \u201cThese Muslims are not some alien species.\u201d Johnson criticised newspaper editors who thought an \u201cIslamo-panicky headline [was] good for sales\u201d and \u201cpoliticians hungry for votes\u201d who made the same calculation. He said his great-grandfather Ali Kemal, a Turkish politician, had been a Muslim, and so he hoped he would not be accused of Islamophobia for quoting Winston Churchill\u2019s claim that there was \u201cno stronger retrograde force\u201d in the world than Islam. \u201cIt is time to get deep down and dirty and examine the central charge made by everyone from Winston Churchill to the Pope, namely that the real problem with the Islamic world is Islam,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cWe must be honest and accept that there is more than a grain of truth in Churchill\u2019s analysis of the economic and social consequences of the religion.\u201d After describing the beauty of the Sistine Chapel, Johnson wrote: \u201cThere is nothing like it in Muslim art of that or any age, not just because it is beyond the technical accomplishment of Islamic art, but because it is so theologically offensive to Islam.\u201d Tell Mama said the essay portrayed Muslims as \u201ca wave or horde \u2026 who had little time for the intricacies and legacies of civilisations like that of Rome\u201d. Johnson\u2019s words gave the impression Muslims were somehow \u201cmentally constrained by Islam\u201d, they said. \u201cThat shows a lack of understanding of Islam, and there are many Muslims whom Islam has inspired to produce some of the most beautiful art forms in their love for life and beauty. We hope Johnson works to support all communities in the future, and we are here to assist and support that.\u201d Johnson\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",
