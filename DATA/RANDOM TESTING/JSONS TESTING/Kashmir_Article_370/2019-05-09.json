The system we created, the Octopus Editorial System (OES), is what we still use to write and manage articles for print. The technology behind it is simple and robust, and has stood the test of time having published the Guardian and Observer in Berliner and tabloid formats, while integrating closely with new online and mobile publishing platforms. Key to the success of OES is the way that it encourages the creation and management of content in a structured way, with a database design that handles metadata for individual pieces of content we create. How does structure help content creation? Discussion of structured content often focuses on its repurposing and reuse. However the approach also brings advantages for our content creation workflows. Using our OES editorial system, staff can edit an entire news story (headline, standfirst, image, body text) as a complete bundle of content (\u2018story bundle\u2019). Or different editors can work on those four elements. In this way, as publication deadlines loom, editors can concentrate effort on the stories, or parts of stories, that still need work and forget about everything that is already complete. This not only applies to stories destined for publication in print, but also for those being prepared for digital platforms. The technology was designed with editorial staff in mind. When analysing their needs, it became apparent that the tools they required must manage content in a structured way in order to meet the demands of a fast-paced, multi-user, deadline-driven environment. Preparing content for reuse Once content has been completed, we have a bundle of content, with a well written headline, fact checked story content and appropriate picture that tells a story that is ready to publish on any platform. Adding structure to our content allows it to be automatically sent to the Guardian\u2019s Content Application Programming Interface (Content API). The Content API is used to publish content to the Guardian and Observer websites, and is used internally to automate some tasks. The Content API stores every piece of content already published, or that has been scheduled to be published, for the Guardian and Observer. Fully automated workflows The most obvious way to reuse our content is to sell it to other publishers. For example, if the Guardian publishes an authoritative story about media, health or education, special interest publications in those industries may want to re-publish some of that content, and will pay for the privilege. The structure of the story bundle is important here, since The Guardian may have rights to publish the pictures that are part of the story in print or on our website, but may not have rights to syndicate them. The structured approach solves this by allowing syndication rights to be attached to individual parts of the story bundle, so the syndication process can be accurately automated. The Kindle Edition is generated automatically from the Content API without human intervention. Using metadata carried with the story, this edition can honour the structure of the newspaper, putting stories in the correct section and page order they were published in print. This is an example of where our structured content is used to automatically create a product for publication every day. Partially automated workflow The iPad Daily Edition uses the Content API to automatically generate a first cut of stories from the paper. This is a curated product, so although the process is partially automated, production staff intervene to enhance and change article content to add value. For example, the print version of a story will not include video, but the Content API could include video since this may have been added for the online version.

The embedded ideological message: if you\u2019re broke, it\u2019s your own fault, so suck it up, make some air sandwiches, and whatever you do, don\u2019t blame the system. Bootstraps! John Wayne! Horatio Alger! Of course, putting all the onus for hardship on the individual obscures the real reasons more people than ever are having trouble affording the bare necessities, let alone \u201cnonessentials\u201d like recipe boxes geared toward those too exhausted to shop for groceries \u2014 which, it bears mentioning, are not free, themselves \u2013 while a lucky few live in luxury: stagnant wages, the destruction of organized labor, and an increasing reliance on rising rents and consumer debt as capitalism develops into a new, finance and real estate-centric phase with the help of government policymakers. If you want to get really angry, take a look at the ever widening gulf between wages and productivity, or the fact that the richest 1% of Americans now control a share of the country\u2019s wealth not seen since the Great Depression. As Bryan Quinby of leftist podcast Street Fight Radio put it in a video for Means.tv: \u201cI know where the money is. Jeff Bezos has it, the Waltons have it \u2026 they took it from us. Your work made that money. You deserve that money. That\u2019s your money. \u201d Now, I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t try to save money or plan for the future. It\u2019s never a bad idea to do what you can to make life in hell world as survivable as possible for the duration of your time on this dying planet. But if you continually come up short, don\u2019t blame your salad bar addiction. Blame the global 1% and the system that enables them. And then, if I may offer some long-term financial advice of my own, take collective action against them. There\u2019s more than enough food and beverages to go around, if only we can stop those at the top from eating our lunch.

It is a beautiful region, significantly less polluted than cities such as Beijing and rich in mountains, lakes, rice terraces and gorges.

We spent the morning seeing the sights of the park, and in the afternoon we went to watch the Impression Lijiang show. It is an open-air theatre performance of song and dance by one of the top directors in China, Zhang Yimou (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/sep/26/philipfrench\">Hero</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/dec/24/2\">House of Flying Daggers</a>).

It is a big production with real horses, effects to create fog and mist, and a singing cast, a soundtrack of traditional music. The story is narrated over the speakers in Mandarin, with subtitles running on an LCD screen at the bottom of the stage, just out of shot.</p> <p>The audience was huge: there are so many tourists in China. We were sitting to the side, so I got up to move closer to the VIP section in the middle to be able to shoot this composition. I ignored the guards. Luckily, they didn\u2019t carry me away.

This was a bright, overcast afternoon \u2013 perfect, really, for taking photographs.</p> <p>I had been waiting for something, a scene that would sum up how I felt about the show.
