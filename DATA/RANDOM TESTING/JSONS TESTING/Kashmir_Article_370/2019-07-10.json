But the headline of Conn\u2019s article, perhaps inadvertently, falls into the trap that could lead to losing this argument yet again. Looking at this from a standpoint of \u201cWhat has the EU done for us?\u201d risks reinforcing the lazy and damaging characterisation of a monolithic EU handing down to us, telling us what\u2019s best for us and so on. The reality is that the benefits of EU membership have been secured because we have a voice in the EU\u2019s institutions \u2013 leading, shaping and influencing, and making the case for strategic priorities like the regional investment Conn is right to highlight. Those of us who believe leaving the EU is a wrong and highly damaging course need to pitch our argument not on the basis of what the EU has done for us, but on what more we can do together by staying in the European Union.
