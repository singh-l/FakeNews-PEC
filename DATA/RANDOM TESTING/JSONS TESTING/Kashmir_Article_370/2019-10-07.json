      "bodyText": "Anti-Brexit campaigners are to renew their bid for a court order to force Boris Johnson to seek an extension to article 50 if he fails to get a Brexit deal through the Commons next week. The three campaigners \u2013 green energy entrepreneur Dale Vince, director of the Good Law Project, Jolyon Maugham QC, and the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC \u2013 lost their first attempt to win a court order against the prime minister on Monday. Lord Pentland, an outer house judge in the court of session in Scotland, ruled the courts had to trust promises made by the UK government last Friday that Johnson would uphold the Benn act\u2019s provisions and not try to undermine them. The European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act, known as the Benn act, requires Johnson to write to the EU asking for an extension until 31 January if he fails to get a Brexit deal agreed at Westminster by 19 October. Pentland refused to grant the three applicants an interdict, or injunction that would force Johnson to obey the act, after the government told the court in writing Johnson accepted \u201che cannot act so as to prevent the letter requesting the specified extension in the act from being sent.\u201d The judge said his decision was reached \u201con the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do.\u201d On Tuesday the campaigners\u2019 lawyers will appeal against Pentland\u2019s decision to three judges \u2013 the lord president Lord Carloway, Lord Brodie and Lord Drummond Young \u2013 sitting in the senior inner house of the court of session. The lawyers are expected to argue Pentland was wrong to set aside substantial evidence the government was actively planning to thwart the Benn act. Speaking after Pentland\u2019s ruling, Maugham said the appeal was based on one key question: \u201cWhether the court is right to expect the prime minister to comply with the law.\u201d They will reinforce that argument by also asking the judges to consider taking control of the process by using unique powers available to the inner house, known as nobile officium, which empowers judges to take action in a situation where a remedy is needed. In an unprecedented move, Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, the campaigners\u2019 advocate, will ask the court to use their nobile officium powers to write the letter required under the Benn act on Johnson\u2019s behalf if he fails to do so in time. Last Friday, lawyers for the advocate general, the UK government\u2019s Scottish law officer, failed to get that application thrown out. Drummond-Young said the case was unique but it had to be heard soon to ensure it could be properly dealt with, since it was likely to be appealed at the UK supreme court by whichever side loses. The courts had very little time to deal with this, given Brexit day was due on 31 October, he said. To the campaigners\u2019 surprise, Pentland ruled that statements by the prime minister and Downing Street officials that the UK would still leave the EU on 31 October regardless of the Benn act were political statements. Pentland also said the applicants had not proven that Johnson would breach the act by subverting it. At a key point in Friday\u2019s hearing, O\u2019Neill told Pentland that the BBC had just quoted a Downing Street source arguing the Benn act\u2019s \u201cvery specific narrow duty\u201d did not prevent the government from \u201cother communications, private and public\u201d arguing against any delay.

In his judgment <strong>Lord Pentland </strong>effectively said he would take the government at its word and that, if Johnson broke his promise to the court, that would be \u201cdestructive\u201d to the constitution. Pentland said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If I may put the point another way, the government accepts that in executing its political policy it must comply with the 2019 Act. That being the government\u2019s clearly stated position before the court, there is no need for coercive orders against it or against the prime minister to be pronounced. The court should not pronounce coercive orders (or decree for interdict) unless it has been established on the basis of cogent evidence that it is truly necessary for such orders to be granted. In my opinion, that has not been done in the present case.</p> \n   <p>I would add only this. I approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>James Duddridge, a Brexit minister, has dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d and \u201cnot true\u201d a claim that the government plans to lower employment and environmental standards after Brexit.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/07/brexit-latest-news-boris-johnson-court-to-decide-if-boris-johnson-can-be-forced-to-sign-extension-letter-live-news?page=with:block-5d9b542a8f08fbb0c17228e3#block-5d9b542a8f08fbb0c17228e3\">4.12pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/jennifer-arcuri-refuses-to-rule-out-claims-of-affair-with-boris-johnson\">Jennifer Arcuri, the American businesswoman at the centre of a conflict of interest row involving the prime minister confirmed she had a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with Boris Johnson and refused to rule out claims they had an affair.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/07/far-right-swooping-on-towns-to-exploit-tensions-report-says\">Far-right activists are exploiting community tensions by swooping into towns and cities and distorting the truth in an effort to turn residents against minorities, particularly Muslims, the government\u2019s chief adviser on extremism has found.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/07/mp-stephen-hepburn-suspended-over-sexual-harassment-allegation\">The Labour MP Stephen Hepburn has been suspended from the party while officials investigate a complaint that he sexually harassed a female party member.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/07/families-lose-high-court-challenge-over-special-needs-funding\">Families who launched a landmark legal challenge to the government\u2019s funding </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/oct/07/families-lose-high-court-challenge-over-special-needs-funding\">of services for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) have lost their high court case.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9b61758f081108db9c3e4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-07T16:04:46.023Z\">5.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cUlster says No,\u201d is one of the historic cries of unionism.

Dr <strong>Alex Armitage</strong>, the Green party candidate for Hackney North and Stoke Newington who is leading on the policy told the Guardian:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our policy stems from the fact that we\u2019re recognising more and more that the prohibition of drugs is a complete and utter failure, particularly for people marginalised in society.</p> \n   <p>It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re dealer recruited into organised crime group after being excluded from school, or a person who was abused as a child who uses heroin to numb the pain or whether you live in an affluent area and worry about your home being burgled by people who need to steal to enable their drug use. It\u2019s an issue that affects everyone in society in one way or another.</p> \n   <p>Particularly in south America, where cocaine originates from, you have murder and disappearances on a mass scale, massive environmental destruction and visible corruption of government. Rather than having short term solution to problems we face, the Greens are taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture.</p> \n   <p>All of this death, harm and destruction stems from the fact that drug use is illegal and unregulated. The only way to regulate drug use is to create a legal system.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Under the proposals, closely regulated specialist pharmacies would be permitted to sell recreational drugs to adults at fixed doses and prices over the counter after a safety consultation. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cPeople would know exactly what they were taking,\u201d Armitage said. \u201cIt solves the problem of drug dealers cutting drugs with unknown substances.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p><em>UPDATE: </em>We have amended the copy above to remove a reference to two class A drugs.

But during last week\u2019s Tory conference they became confident that the \u201cFarage factor\u201d would not scupper Johnson\u2019s chances of victory. They were cheered by opinion poll and focus group findings that the PM would not be blamed for the latest delay to Brexit. As one aide said: \u201cThe public see him as Mr. Brexit and the only one who can deliver it. They know who is responsible [for delay] and we will keep reminding them of it.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Team Boris is confident of success in what is a \u201cblame game\u201d at three levels\u2014pinning responsibility for the coming extension on the EU, Parliament and the judiciary. It could be called the ABB strategy\u2014anyone but Boris.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/delivery-rather-than-detail-gives-johnson-the-brexit-edge-over-may-htc8lm9f2\">an article in the Times (paywall)</a> the leading psephologist <strong>Prof Sir John Curtice</strong> is not convinced that Johnson will be able to escape the blame so easily.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So far, confidence in Mr Johnson\u2019s handling of Brexit \u2014 and indeed his party\u2019s standing in the polls which, according to Opinium\u2019s latest poll, is, at 38 per cent, higher than at any time since last February, before Mrs May failed to deliver Brexit \u2014 has not suffered in the wake of what are already diminishing expectations among voters that Brexit will be delivered at the end of the month.</p> \n   <p>According to YouGov, at the beginning of September, three in five (60 per cent) Leave voters thought it likely that Brexit would have happened by October 31, while only about one in four (27 per cent) thought it unlikely. Now only about a half of them (49 per cent) expect Mr Johnson to meet the deadline.</p> \n   <p>Still, that potentially leaves a lot of voters whose hopes and expectations will be dashed if Brexit is not delivered at the end of the month. Of course, they may decide that some combination of the EU, the judges, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson are responsible for any failure to deliver Brexit. But expect Nigel Farage to point the finger of blame at Mr Johnson and his Conservative Party. Much could yet depend on who wins and loses the blame game.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Rob Ford</strong>, a politics professor, thinks leave voters will turn on Johnson if there is an extension.

If Johnson won back half of the Brexit party vote then he might win a comfortable majority, with 348 seats to Labour\u2019s 201. If he goes further and wins back three-quarters of Farage\u2019s Brexiteers then the number of Conservative seats increased at around 370 to Labour\u2019s 185 - a commanding majority.</p> \n   <p>Might this actually happen? We do think that the Brexit party vote is softer than some think, for a couple of reasons. First, when these voters are asked who would make the best prime minister - Johnson or Corbyn- <a href=\"https://matthewjgoodwin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=622abafa668ae542eeba8dd1f&amp;id=d23ab49459&amp;e=bec083766b\">they break 84% to 1%</a> for Johnson. Lord Ashcroft asked a slightly different question, whether they would want to see a Conservative government led by Johnson or a Labour government led by Corbyn. <a href=\"https://matthewjgoodwin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=622abafa668ae542eeba8dd1f&amp;id=91c7bbe7ca&amp;e=bec083766b\">94% opted for a Johnson government</a>. A campaign that inevitably presents voters with this simple binary choice would likely see many Brexit party voters conclude \u201cJohnson\u201d.</p> \n   <p>Even this week, as the pressure on Johnson became clear, large majorities of Brexit party voters still felt that <a href=\"https://matthewjgoodwin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=622abafa668ae542eeba8dd1f&amp;id=6af18f56ff&amp;e=bec083766b\">he is competent, decisive, strong, likeable, authentic and \u2018in touch with ordinary people\u2019</a>. In fact, 91% of Brexit party voters openly reject the idea that Johnson should resign and want him to remain as prime minister. Put simply, these do not look like people who are about to revolt <em>en masse</em>. It was also telling that when Nigel Farage called on Johnson to resign he was widely criticised by his own voters on social media. Furthermore, so long as Johnson appears sincere in his support for a \u2018meaningful\u2019, \u2018clean\u2019 or \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit then these Brexit party voters are instinctively on side. As <a href=\"https://matthewjgoodwin.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=622abafa668ae542eeba8dd1f&amp;id=12f22e5e24&amp;e=bec083766b\">polling made clear</a> this week, 81% want Britain to leave with no deal while 91% would \u2018not be worried\u2019 if Britain left without a deal. <br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Five years ago Ford and Goodwin co-wrote an acclaimed book on Ukip, Revolt on the Right.

He says he thinks the chances of the UK and the EU agreeing a deal this week are now \u201cclose to zero\u201d, and that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening on 31 October are also \u201cextremely small\u201d. We\u2019re heading for an election, he assumes.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>UK ministers admit privately there is little prospect of agreement. As one put it: \u201cIf the consent mechanism [on regulation] were the only problem, then a deal would be doable. But if we say Northern Ireland must be in the UK customs territory and the EU says it must be in the [EU] customs union, the problems are insurmountable. That\u2019s where we are.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Downing Street\u2019s official line remains that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal. At the same time, it insists the government \u201cwill obey\u201d the Benn Act approved by parliament, forcing Johnson to seek an extension to UK membership if a deal has not been approved by parliament by 19 October. Ministers refuse to say how these contradictory positions will be reconciled. Some admit privately they do not know.</p> \n   <p>We think Johnson will pursue a strategy some aides describe as \u201cbeing dragged, kicking and screaming\u201d into an extension, so Leave voters know he is doing it against his will. This is why he still promises \u201cno delay\u201d even though he knows the prospects of a deal are remote.</p> \n   <p>He may play for time on 19 October, so the Benn Act is tested in the courts (Johnson would swiftly be taken to court if he did not comply immediately). The courts could send a letter on the government\u2019s behalf, or order a civil servant or another minister to do so. Outright refusal to obey the law is a non-starter; it could provoke several resignations including those of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and Robert Buckland, the justice secretary.</p> \n   <p>So we think that, sooner or later, Johnson will send the letter required by the act, but that too could be tested in the courts. It will likely describe the proposed delay as \u201cparliament\u2019s extension\u201d, not one sought by the government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d9af96a8f081108db9c399e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-07T08:38:17.877Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from my colleague <strong>Severin Carrell.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/1181125933643771904\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Seems <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaleVince?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DaleVince</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JolyonMaugham</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joannaccherry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@joannaccherry</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BennAct?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BennAct</a> decision won\u2019t be published until noon, in writing.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has sought to deflect the blame for the Brexit impasse on to Britain\u2019s EU counterparts, as Boris Johnson\u2019s plans continue to meet a frosty reception. Johnson himself has claimed that the EU has not yet explained in detail what its objections to his plan are. (See 12.32pm.) Anti-Brexit campaigners have failed in a legal bid to get a Scottish court to issue an order saying Johnson must seek a Brexit extension if he does not agree a deal with the EU, as the Benn Act requires. But they claimed that that case served a valuable function because, in evidence to the court, the government committed itself to complying with this legislation. In his judgment Lord Pentland effectively said he would take the government at its word and that, if Johnson broke his promise to the court, that would be \u201cdestructive\u201d to the constitution. Pentland said: If I may put the point another way, the government accepts that in executing its political policy it must comply with the 2019 Act. That being the government\u2019s clearly stated position before the court, there is no need for coercive orders against it or against the prime minister to be pronounced. The court should not pronounce coercive orders (or decree for interdict) unless it has been established on the basis of cogent evidence that it is truly necessary for such orders to be granted. In my opinion, that has not been done in the present case. I would add only this. I approach matters on the basis that it would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do. James Duddridge, a Brexit minister, has dismissed as \u201crubbish\u201d and \u201cnot true\u201d a claim that the government plans to lower employment and environmental standards after Brexit. (See 4.12pm.) Jennifer Arcuri, the American businesswoman at the centre of a conflict of interest row involving the prime minister confirmed she had a \u201cvery close bond\u201d with Boris Johnson and refused to rule out claims they had an affair. Far-right activists are exploiting community tensions by swooping into towns and cities and distorting the truth in an effort to turn residents against minorities, particularly Muslims, the government\u2019s chief adviser on extremism has found. The Labour MP Stephen Hepburn has been suspended from the party while officials investigate a complaint that he sexually harassed a female party member. Families who launched a landmark legal challenge to the government\u2019s funding of services for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) have lost their high court case. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. \u201cUlster says No,\u201d is one of the historic cries of unionism. The DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson has inverted that in a statement - one of several we\u2019ve had from the party recently - strongly criticising the Irish government for its stance on Brexit. Wilson said: It seems the \u2018not an inch\u2019 approach in Dublin will lead to no deal. How times have changed. Its now a case of \u2018Dublin Says No\u2019. The DUP has worked with the prime minister to place a reasonable proposal on the table. It may not be perfect but it\u2019s a fair deal. It recognises our unique situation and respects the referendum result ... In every negotiation there must be give and take. The Irish prime minister must realise that we will not support Northern Ireland being held to ransom by either Dublin or Brussels. In response to another urgent question Conor Burns, an international trade minister, has told MPs that the government will publish its plans for the tariffs that would apply in the event of a no-deal Brexit \u201cshortly\u201d. That may mean tomorrow. Theresa May\u2019s government published its own tariff schedule for no deal, but the new government will take a different approach. In the Commons James Duddridge, the Brexit minister, has just said that his boss, the Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, is going around Europe \u201cwhipping up support and enthusiasm\u201d for the PM\u2019s Brexit deal. (If Barclay is supposed to be whipping up enthusiasm for the deal, there is precious little evidence so far that his mission is having any success.) These are from Dale Vince, the businessman who took the case to the Scottish court of session calling for a ruling saying Boris Johnson would have to obey the Benn Act, along with Joanna Cherry and Jolyon Maugham. In her question a few minutes ago Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said the government\u2019s refusal to publish the legal text would prompt fears that the government was prepared to lower standards. Surely the public had a right to know if the PM was prepared to sacrifice the quality of food on supermarket shelves, the rights of workers to take holiday and the rights of children to breath clean air? James Duddridge, the Brext minister, replied: Quite frankly, that\u2019s a load of rubbish. That is not our intention. And our constituents, if they are worried and scared as a result of what the Liberal Democrats say, that is a terrible thing. It just simply is not true. The Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi asked if the DUP had seen the full legal text. Why would it be right for them to see it, but not the other opposition parties. Duddridge said he would not comment. He said MPs who had been ministers would know that, in a negotiation, different people see different bits of text. In the Commons Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, said something did not add up in relation to what James Duddridge said about there being no need for new infrastructure in Ireland. He said Boris Johnson told the BBC last week there would be a system of customs checks away from the border. But the plan published last week said customs checks would be carried out at traders\u2019 premises, or other designated locations. And it said goods would be under customs supervision as they crossed the border. So how can you have customs checks with no customs infrastructure? Duddridge replied: The government are looking for a tailored solution. He said the sort of procedures mentioned in the plan were already being used in some places. Duddridge is responding to Starmer. He says what the PM said in the Commons on Thursday last week about there being no need for any new infrastructure anywhere was correct. And he says the government is committed to upholding rights. That will become clear when the text is published, he says. Starmer is responding. He says MPs have not seen the 44-page legal text. That means they have to guess, or, even worse, take the PM\u2019s word for it. He says the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says there is a contradiction between the plan and what Boris Johnson told MPs last week about there being no need for any new infrastructure in Northern Ireland. He says Duddridge should clear this up. Both Varadkar and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, have called for the text to be published, he says. What is the government hiding? He says, if it is true that workers\u2019 and environmental rights will be protected, the full legal text should be published so people can be reassured. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has just asked his urgent question on when the government the legal text of its new Brexit plan James Duddridge, the Brexit minister, is replying. He says the government is \u201cunconditionally committed\u201d to finding a solution to the Irish border issue. It is committed to avoiding \u201cinfrastructure, checks or controls\u201d at the border in Ireland. He says the government published details of its new plan last week. At the same time it also shared a legal text of the proposed changed to the withdrawal agreement with the European commission, but on a confidential basis. He says the government will only publish this at a time when doing so would help it get a deal. The SNP has today announced it is setting up a social justice and fairness commission, which it says will show how Scotland could use independence to create a fairer society. It is intended to complement the work of the SNP\u2019s sustainable growth commission, which reported last year. Shona Robison, the former Scottish government\u2019s health secretary who will convene the commission, said: Independence is fundamentally about creating a better Scotland. The social justice and fairness commission will explore in detail how we can use the powers of independence to end poverty, tackle inequality and improve the lives of families across Scotland. That\u2019s a crucial task \u2013 both for persuading people of the case for independence, and for building a better country once we achieve it. Here is the full list of commission members. Plaid Cymru has confirmed that it would support Jeremy Corbyn as leader of an interim administration to prevent a no-deal Brexit. A Plaid Cymru source said: It\u2019s not about who, but about how we stop a disastrous crash-out Brexit. This is about policies not personalities. The focus now must be on ensuring that the anti-no deal legislation is enacted. We cannot afford to do anything to jeopardise that \u2013 that includes playing party political games over who should lead a caretaker administration. Plaid Cymru has said we will work with anyone who can command a majority if a caretaker administration is needed to block a no-deal, secure an extension and deliver a referendum. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. This is from the SNP MP Joanna Cherry, one of the people who brought the case to the Scottish court of session in an attempt to get a ruling that Boris Johnson must comply with the Benn Act. She said: As a result of this important court action, we have forced the Tory government to concede that the prime minister will comply with the law, and promise to send a letter requesting a Brexit extension and not frustrate the purpose of the Benn Act. However, given Boris Johnson\u2019s slippery track record of acting unlawfully, and the contradictory statements issued by the UK government - we do not trust the Tory leader or believe he can be taken at his word to obey the letter and spirit of the law. As such, we will appeal the decision, and expect that appeal to be heard tomorrow. A senior member of the Home Office\u2019s drugs advisory panel has quit, claiming political interference is undermining its independence. Prof Alex Stevens, who worked on the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), has posted a thread on Twitter explaining his decision, which was revealed by the Guardian. Here is a Guardian video of the Extinction Rebellion protests around Westminster. This is from Neale Richmond, an Irish senator and Fine Gael Europe spokesperson, explaining for the benefit of Boris Johnson (see 12.32pm) what the EU thinks the problems are with the UK\u2019s Brexit plan. Bruno Bonnell, a French MP for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s En Marche! party, told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live this morning that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan was \u201calmost like a joke\u201d. He explained: It\u2019s not a final version - it\u2019s almost like a joke. We don\u2019t even understand it ... This is not a genuine offer. This is clearly a political manipulation to put the responsibility of a no-deal Brexit on the EU\u2019s side. Explaining his objection to the proposal, he said: First of all, what he is suggesting right now is a very complex process, and even more complicated than what is proposed by the backstop. Secondly, it\u2019s again a last-minute proposal, as if he wanted to force the issue and put the responsibility of a no-deal Brexit onto the EU\u2019s shoulders. I mean we don\u2019t want to pick and choose here. He is the one who refused the deal that was in place, that was proposed, that was negotiated. The European commission said it plans to \u201ctake stock\u201d later this week in terms of making an assessment of the UK\u2019s Brexit plan. At its regular, daily briefing, the commission\u2019s chief spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said: Talks will continue today and this week in order to give the UK the opportunity to present their proposals in more detail and then we will take stock with member states and the European parliament throughout the week. And, as we have said before, everyday counts in these talks. I think we have said many times that we are available 24/7. Labour MP Stephen Hepburn has been suspended from the party following a complaint of sexual harassment, the Press Association reports. It is understood his case has been referred to the national constitutional committee and he has been suspended pending that process. Ian Jones from the Press Association has filed this, looking at four potential dates for the general election. Time is running out for a general election to take place before the Christmas season. The earliest date for polling day is probably Thursday November 28. By law, parliament has to be dissolved 25 working days before a general election. For an election on November 28, dissolution would need to take place on October 24. This would give MPs time to debate and vote on the Queen\u2019s Speech, which is taking place on October 14. It also avoids a clash with the EU summit of October 17/18. But MPs may want to wait until after October 31, the day on which the government says the UK will leave the EU, with or without a deal, before triggering an election. Under this scenario, MPs could hold the trigger-vote on November 4 or 5, parliament would be dissolved on November 7, with polling day falling on December 12. A dissolution any later than November 7 would push the election very close to Christmas. A third scenario could see MPs try to fix polling day for as early as possible in the new year, probably on January 9. This would mean dissolution on December 2, however, and it seems unlikely politicians would wish to spend the festive period campaigning. MPs may therefore decide to sit tight and wait until Christmas is out of the way before triggering an election, with dissolution potentially on January 9 followed by polling day on February 13. The Green party has proposed the legalisation of drug use in the UK and the establishment of a regulated market with tightly-controlled specialist pharmacies selling currently illegal substances. It appears to be the first time a UK political party has gone so far as to call for the radical change in drug policy, and it comes amid heightened concern over the exploitation of teenagers by county lines drug gangs and record drug-related deaths. Dr Alex Armitage, the Green party candidate for Hackney North and Stoke Newington who is leading on the policy told the Guardian: Our policy stems from the fact that we\u2019re recognising more and more that the prohibition of drugs is a complete and utter failure, particularly for people marginalised in society. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re dealer recruited into organised crime group after being excluded from school, or a person who was abused as a child who uses heroin to numb the pain or whether you live in an affluent area and worry about your home being burgled by people who need to steal to enable their drug use. It\u2019s an issue that affects everyone in society in one way or another. Particularly in south America, where cocaine originates from, you have murder and disappearances on a mass scale, massive environmental destruction and visible corruption of government. Rather than having short term solution to problems we face, the Greens are taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture. All of this death, harm and destruction stems from the fact that drug use is illegal and unregulated. The only way to regulate drug use is to create a legal system. Under the proposals, closely regulated specialist pharmacies would be permitted to sell recreational drugs to adults at fixed doses and prices over the counter after a safety consultation. \u201cPeople would know exactly what they were taking,\u201d Armitage said. \u201cIt solves the problem of drug dealers cutting drugs with unknown substances.\u201d UPDATE: We have amended the copy above to remove a reference to two class A drugs. The party has now clarified its position and it says its policy to regulate the supply of drugs, including fuller details of the drugs covered, will be released in due course. Here is some Twitter comment on the Scottish court judgment. From the law lecturer and Times journalist Raphael Hogarth From my colleague Severin Carrell From David Anderson, the QC, crossbench peer and former independent reviewer of terror legislation From the FT\u2019s legal commentator David Allen Green Here is a link to the full text of the Scottish court\u2019s judgment. These are from Jolyon Maugham, the lawyer who has lost the case in Scotland intended to get the court to issue an order compelling Boris Johnson to comply with the Benn Act. Here is James Cleverly, the Conservative party chairman\u2019s, take on the Brexit crisis. There are five urgent questions in the Commons today. During his interviews at Watford hospital Boris Johnson also said he was willing to speak to President Trump about the American diplomat\u2019s wife who is using diplomatic immunity to escape criminal proceedings in relation to a car crash that killed Harry Dunn, 19, in Northamptonshire. Johnson said: I think everybody\u2019s sympathies are very much with the family of Harry Dunn and our condolences to them for their tragic loss. I must answer you directly, I do not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose. And I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of law as they are carried out in this country. That\u2019s a point that we\u2019ve raised or are raising today with the american ambassador here in the UK and I hope it will be resolved very shortly. And to anticipate a question you might want to raise, if we can\u2019t resolve it then of course I will be raising it myself personally with the White House. Anti-Brexit campaigners have failed in an attempt to force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension to article 50 if he is unable to get a Brexit deal through parliament, my colleague Severin Carrell reports. His story goes on: Lord Pentland, sitting in the court of session in Edinburgh, rejected their request for a court order instructing the prime minister to seek an extension if he cannot get a deal passed by the Commons this month. Here is the full story. Boris Johnson has also restated his claim that the UK will definitely leave the EU on 31 October - even though MPs have passed the Benn Act, which is intended to stop that happening. Asked about the Scottish court case about whether he must send a letter requesting an extension in the event of there being no deal, Johnson said: We will study any judgments, of course, very closely, as we always do. We will respect the law. And we will leave the European Union on October 31. Clearly, that\u2019s what the people of this country voted for. I think most people just want just to get Brexit done. The court of sessions judgement on Brexit will be out at 12.45pm, the lawyer Jolyon Maugham says. This is what Boris Johnson said at Watford hospital when a reporter asked him if his Brexit plan was \u201cdead in the water\u201d. He replied: Our proposal is very fair, very reasonable. What it does is respect the Good Friday agreement, the peace process in Northern Ireland. It makes sure there\u2019s no hard border, no checks at all at the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It also goes further in allowing Northern Ireland and Ireland in alignment, both for agrifoods, for cattle and so on, but also for industrial goods as well. That\u2019s a big step forward, big advance, big compromise by the UK government. What we are saying to our friends is, this is a very generous, fair and reasonable offer that we have made. What we would like to hear from you now is what your thoughts are. And if you have issues with any of the proposals that we\u2019ve come up with, then let\u2019s get into the detail and discuss them. It was then put to Johnson that his Finnish opposite number, Antti Rinne, had said Johnson was only just now realising what a \u201cbig mess\u201d Brexit is and that Emmanuel Macron, the French president, was saying a deal would have to be agreed by Friday. Johnson replied: Well, I spoke to both Antti Rinne, the Finnish prime minster, and to Emmanuel Macron yesterday. And I think they can see that there is an argument now for pushing on and getting on with some substantive talks on the detail of what we are proposing ... The issue is, what is the EU\u2019s objection [to the UK plan]. We haven\u2019t really heard the detail from them about what they think the problems are. It is time for use to get together and really thrash this thing out. Johnson\u2019s claim not to know why the EU is objecting to his plan is surprising. Everyone else seems to know, and Johnson himself has spoken to a series of EU leaders, including Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, Donald Tusk, the European council president, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM). There is a good summary of EU objections here, in the statement from the European parliament\u2019s Brexit steering group. Johnson also refused to answer questions about the Jennifer Arcuri interview on Good Morning Britain this morning (see 9.17am), saying he had already said all he wanted to on this matter. Boris Johnson has been visiting Watford general hospital this morning. Looking at the photographs from the visit, it seems that for the second time in a week he\u2019s been engaging in mug politics - getting your chinaware to do your political messaging. Here is last week\u2019s example. Johnson has also been giving interviews. I will post the highlights shortly. The lawyer Jolyon Maugham has a useful Twitter thread on what to expect from today\u2019s court of session Brexit judgment. It starts here. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing, and nothing was said by the prime minister\u2019s spokesman to suggest that Boris Johnson thinks there is much chance of the UK reaching a Brexit agreement with the EU this week. Johnson is due to hold telephone calls today with the prime ministers of Sweden, Denmark and Poland, but the spokesman did not announce any plans for Johnson to hold face-to-face meetings with his EU counterparts and he would not deny a report saying a meeting with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has not taken place because Merkel\u2019s office could not find a slot for him in the diary. There was a stage when Johnson was claiming that the UK was making significant progress in its talks with the EU. But the spokesman was not using language like that this morning, although when pressed he said that the EU did view the publication of the UK plans last week as a \u201cstep forward\u201d. The spokesman also kept stressing that it was now up to the EU to compromise. Asked about Stef Blok, the Dutch foreign minister, saying this morning that the EU wanted \u201cmore realism and clarity\u201d from the UK on Brexit, the spokesman replied: We are ready to talk with the EU at a pace to secure a deal so that we can move on and build a new partnership between the UK and the EU, but if this is to be possible the EU must match the compromises that the UK has made. Blok made his comment after a meeting with Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing. I will post again after 11.30am. On the BBC\u2019s Westminster Hour last night Lee Rowley, a Tory Brexiter who voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal three times, said he did not think leave voters would blame Boris Johnson if Brexit were delayed. He explained: I think the British people have more or less clocked what\u2019s going on here. And I was out in my constituency, North East Derbyshire - 60% leave seat, formerly Labour-held for 80 years \u2013 this weekend. I lost track of the number of people who said to me on the doorstep \u2013we know what\u2019s going on, Boris is trying to get a deal and he is also trying to get us out. And if he doesn\u2019t achieve that, and Boris is clear that he is going to do that, but if he doesn\u2019t, we know where the problem will be. Because it\u2019s the same problem that\u2019s been there\u2019s been for the last two years. Parliament doesn\u2019t want to leave. One of the key questions in British politics at the moment is whether pro-leave voters will blame Boris Johnson if Brexit has to be extended, and line up behind Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party at the general election, or whether they will give Johnson the benefit on the grounds that at least he tried. As Mujtaba Rahman says in his Eurasia briefing (see 9.57am), No 10 used to think a Brexit delay would be disastrous for the Tories electorally, but now they have changed their mind. Rahman says: The election could turn on this question: how damaging will an extension be for Boris? His strategy is to make enough gains in Labour-held leave areas in the North and Midlands to offset likely losses to the SNP in Scotland and the pro-Remain Lib Dems in the South. This gamble would be compounded by an extension, which would likely play into the hands of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, who would cry betrayal. To win a majority, the Tories need to further squeeze the Brexit party\u2019s vote. Initially, Boris allies were nervous about the impact of an extension. But during last week\u2019s Tory conference they became confident that the \u201cFarage factor\u201d would not scupper Johnson\u2019s chances of victory. They were cheered by opinion poll and focus group findings that the PM would not be blamed for the latest delay to Brexit. As one aide said: \u201cThe public see him as Mr. Brexit and the only one who can deliver it. They know who is responsible [for delay] and we will keep reminding them of it.\u201d Team Boris is confident of success in what is a \u201cblame game\u201d at three levels\u2014pinning responsibility for the coming extension on the EU, Parliament and the judiciary. It could be called the ABB strategy\u2014anyone but Boris. But in an article in the Times (paywall) the leading psephologist Prof Sir John Curtice is not convinced that Johnson will be able to escape the blame so easily. So far, confidence in Mr Johnson\u2019s handling of Brexit \u2014 and indeed his party\u2019s standing in the polls which, according to Opinium\u2019s latest poll, is, at 38 per cent, higher than at any time since last February, before Mrs May failed to deliver Brexit \u2014 has not suffered in the wake of what are already diminishing expectations among voters that Brexit will be delivered at the end of the month. According to YouGov, at the beginning of September, three in five (60 per cent) Leave voters thought it likely that Brexit would have happened by October 31, while only about one in four (27 per cent) thought it unlikely. Now only about a half of them (49 per cent) expect Mr Johnson to meet the deadline. Still, that potentially leaves a lot of voters whose hopes and expectations will be dashed if Brexit is not delivered at the end of the month. Of course, they may decide that some combination of the EU, the judges, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson are responsible for any failure to deliver Brexit. But expect Nigel Farage to point the finger of blame at Mr Johnson and his Conservative Party. Much could yet depend on who wins and loses the blame game. Rob Ford, a politics professor, thinks leave voters will turn on Johnson if there is an extension. (BXP is the Brexit party.) But Matthew Goodwin, another academic, takes an alternative view. In a briefing he sent out at the end of last week Goodwin explained in more detail why he thinks, in an election, Johnson could win the support of people currently saying they would vote for the Brexit party. Were Johnson and his team to successfully recruit Brexit party voters [at the general election] then they would likely win sizeable majorities. If Johnson won back half of the Brexit party vote then he might win a comfortable majority, with 348 seats to Labour\u2019s 201. If he goes further and wins back three-quarters of Farage\u2019s Brexiteers then the number of Conservative seats increased at around 370 to Labour\u2019s 185 - a commanding majority. Might this actually happen? We do think that the Brexit party vote is softer than some think, for a couple of reasons. First, when these voters are asked who would make the best prime minister - Johnson or Corbyn- they break 84% to 1% for Johnson. Lord Ashcroft asked a slightly different question, whether they would want to see a Conservative government led by Johnson or a Labour government led by Corbyn. 94% opted for a Johnson government. A campaign that inevitably presents voters with this simple binary choice would likely see many Brexit party voters conclude \u201cJohnson\u201d. Even this week, as the pressure on Johnson became clear, large majorities of Brexit party voters still felt that he is competent, decisive, strong, likeable, authentic and \u2018in touch with ordinary people\u2019. In fact, 91% of Brexit party voters openly reject the idea that Johnson should resign and want him to remain as prime minister. Put simply, these do not look like people who are about to revolt en masse. It was also telling that when Nigel Farage called on Johnson to resign he was widely criticised by his own voters on social media. Furthermore, so long as Johnson appears sincere in his support for a \u2018meaningful\u2019, \u2018clean\u2019 or \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit then these Brexit party voters are instinctively on side. As polling made clear this week, 81% want Britain to leave with no deal while 91% would \u2018not be worried\u2019 if Britain left without a deal. Five years ago Ford and Goodwin co-wrote an acclaimed book on Ukip, Revolt on the Right. Since then some of their views have diverged. Mujtaba Rahman, the Brexit specialist at the Eurasia consultancy who produces regular briefing notes based on what he\u2019s been told by insiders in London and Brussels, has issued an update on the state of play this morning. He says he thinks the chances of the UK and the EU agreeing a deal this week are now \u201cclose to zero\u201d, and that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening on 31 October are also \u201cextremely small\u201d. We\u2019re heading for an election, he assumes. Here\u2019s an extract. UK ministers admit privately there is little prospect of agreement. As one put it: \u201cIf the consent mechanism [on regulation] were the only problem, then a deal would be doable. But if we say Northern Ireland must be in the UK customs territory and the EU says it must be in the [EU] customs union, the problems are insurmountable. That\u2019s where we are.\u201d Downing Street\u2019s official line remains that the UK will leave on 31 October with or without a deal. At the same time, it insists the government \u201cwill obey\u201d the Benn Act approved by parliament, forcing Johnson to seek an extension to UK membership if a deal has not been approved by parliament by 19 October. Ministers refuse to say how these contradictory positions will be reconciled. Some admit privately they do not know. We think Johnson will pursue a strategy some aides describe as \u201cbeing dragged, kicking and screaming\u201d into an extension, so Leave voters know he is doing it against his will. This is why he still promises \u201cno delay\u201d even though he knows the prospects of a deal are remote. He may play for time on 19 October, so the Benn Act is tested in the courts (Johnson would swiftly be taken to court if he did not comply immediately). The courts could send a letter on the government\u2019s behalf, or order a civil servant or another minister to do so. Outright refusal to obey the law is a non-starter; it could provoke several resignations including those of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, and Robert Buckland, the justice secretary. So we think that, sooner or later, Johnson will send the letter required by the act, but that too could be tested in the courts. It will likely describe the proposed delay as \u201cparliament\u2019s extension\u201d, not one sought by the government. This is from my colleague Severin Carrell. The lawyer Jolyon Maugham says he does not know what time the Scottish court judgment will be issued. I had been told 10am, but that may have been duff information. Politicians spend a lot of time in interviews dodging questions, but mostly they are not very good at it. They could all learn by watching Jennifer Arcuri, the American businesswoman at the centre of the scandal over claims that Boris Johnson improperly helped her company with grants and trade mission access when he was mayor of London because they had a very close friendship. She has given an interview to Good Morning Britain this morning, and she managed to give a non-answer that made her look strong and assertive, not weak and evasive. This is what she said when Piers Morgan asked her if she had ever had an intimate relationship with Johnson. She said: Because the press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer, I am really not going to answer that question ... I\u2019m sorry, I am not going to be putting myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer. I\u2019m being used as a pawn. This entire thing is a crazy charade. Arcuri also insisted that her firm had not received favours from Johnson. My colleague Matthew Weaver has written the whole interview up here. In normal circumstances this might be the story of the day, but the UK is only 24 days from a deadline that could pitch the country into a potentially crippling no-deal Brexit and Johnson has much more pressing things on his minds. His options might be affected by a decision in a Scottish court that could determine the extent to which he is constrained by the Benn Act. Here is the Press Association\u2019s preview story. A decision is expected to be made on whether the prime minister can be forced by the courts to send a letter requesting an article 50 extension. Documents submitted to the court of session on behalf of Boris Johnson were read out on Friday, in which he makes it clear he will not attempt to frustrate the so-called Benn Act. However, the petitioners believe No 10 cannot be trusted to abide by the law, so have launched legal action. The legislation, passed by Westminster last month, requires the prime minister to ask the EU for a Brexit extension to January 31 if parliament does not agree to any withdrawal deal Number 10 may come back with by October 19. Legal action - led by businessman Vince Dale, SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC - was launched at the outer house of the court. It seeks to create an order which would force Johnson to send the letter and prohibits him from frustrating the Act\u2019s purpose. This includes banning him from asking EU member states to deny the letter\u2019s request or by sending an additional letter which contradicts it. Aidan O\u2019Neill QC, representing the campaigners behind the legal action, claimed Johnson\u2019s previous statements go against what he has said to the court through the documents. He referred to promises made by the prime minister that he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than send a letter requesting an extension, and that the UK will leave on October 31 \u201cdo or die\u201d. Judge Lord Pentland is expected to announce his decision on the case on Monday. And here is a blog from the Good Law Project, run by Maugham, explaining his case in more detail. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson visits a hospital in Watford. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 12pm: The court of session in Edinburgh is due to deliver its ruling in the legal challenge intended to ensure the PM complies with the Benn Act. 2.30pm: Therese Coffey takes work and pensions questions in the Commons. At some point Jeremy Corbyn is chairing another meeting of the opposition parties in Westminster, to discuss joint efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit. And opposition MPs may press for an emergency debate on a more to force the government to publish the full legal text of its Brexit plan. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all.

That balance is not being met,\u201d the submission said. \u201cAn inadequate Newstart tears at our inclusive social contract, given our society does not guarantee work and thus should ensure that there is an adequate living standard for those that cannot obtain work.\u201d KPMG also backed calls for Newstart and other welfare payments to be determined independently, joining more than a dozen charities, welfare advocacy bodies and health groups. While the Morrison government has said Newstart does not need a boost because it increases twice a year with inflation, KPMG said the consumer price index was an \u201cinappropriate\u201d benchmark. Pension payments are indexed to wages, which have risen more quickly and led to an increasing gap between the age pension and the dole. \u201cIf the unemployment benefit set after the second world war of \u00a31 5s was simply adjusted for inflation it would be equivalent to around $90 per week currently,\u201d KPMG said. \u201cThis is less than a third of the current level and about a quarter of what we believe to be adequate. This demonstrates the inadequacy of using CPI as a basis for adjustment. \u201cThe mixture of expenses likely to be experienced by those unemployed will evolve over time and should not be fixed to a period which is decades old. Thus the cost of a mobile phone would not have been included when the current level of Newstart was evaluated more than 20 years ago (now adjusted for inflation).\u201d The Senate inquiry will hold public hearings on Thursday and Friday.",
