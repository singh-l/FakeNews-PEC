      "body": "<p>Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who\u2019s the most acne-prone of them all? \u201cRHETORICAL QUESTION LOL\u201d I\u2019m thinking bitterly, staring into this week\u2019s device. HiMirror Mini Premium (\u20ac259 [\u00a3240], <a href=\"https://www.himirror.com/en-GB/eshop/product/HiMirrorMini\" title=\"\">himirror.com</a>) is a smart surface that analyses your skin, presenting a breakdown of wrinkles, red spots, dark spots, dark circles, fine lines, pores and roughness. Every day for a week I have been looking into this pitiless oracle \u2013 and the news is never good. I may have hidden depths, but my sallow is all too visible. The mirror keeps flashing up bits of rude advice, telling me to get more calories from peanut butter, or informing me my outer skin \u201closes moisture easily, as it is composed of the oldest and driest cells\u201d. Right to my face. It might as well be calling me Ol\u2019 Wonken Chops.</p> <p>In its favour, HiMirror is technically mesmerising. You line up your face to a virtual mask and it snaps a picture of you to analyse. The mirror is a mirror \u2013 unless you choose to magnify your face by x2 or a horrific x3, in which case it switches to a tablet-style camera in selfie mode. It displays weather and news snippets. (Deeply weird to be given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/08/kashmir-communications-blackout-is-draconian-says-un-envoy\" title=\"\">the latest on Kashmir</a> when obsessing over your pores.) You can connect to Spotify and watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/08/glam-or-sham-are-youtubes-beauty-vloggers-selling-out\" title=\"\">beauty tutorials on YouTube</a>.</p> <p>I\u2019m a sucker for this kind of fluid futurism \u2013 and, unlike many overengineered devices, it works beautifully. When I turn it on, a purple sprite formed of bubbles winks at me, as if I\u2019m taking a wee break from reality. By default, the sides of the mirror illuminate in clear white, although they turn warm and orange if you select the \u201cMakeup studio\u201d option. You can even try virtual makeup effects using augmented reality.</p> <p>The interface is stunning. My face, however, is not. It\u2019s hard, being informed how rough you are on a daily basis, that you rate \u201cpoor\u201d for dark spots but \u201caverage\u201d for wrinkles. This information is tracked via projected graphs. The data is meant to indicate whether your skincare regime is working, which many people will love. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the mirror might as well be shouting: \u201cCome get some ham, Fatty Boom-Boom,\u201d first thing in the morning.</p> <p>It gets worse. The company also offers a suite of accessories with which the mirror can communicate \u2013 including the Smart Body scale (<a href=\"https://www.himirror.com/en-GB/eshop/product/SmartBodyScaleBM616\" title=\"\">\u20ac119, himirror.com</a>). \u201cYou are underfat and with little muscle,\u201d the mirror tells me after they have a little conversation. It flashes up a stick drawing of a man with a tiny arse. I have never been so insulted. It also claims I weigh 6st 12lb (44kg), which can\u2019t be right \u2013 the tureen of chilli I ate last night weighed about that \u2013 yet I spend two days walking around wondering if it\u2019s true. (In fact, I had the scale on a carpet, which threw off the reading. Proper readings, on a hard surface, reveal that I weigh just more than 10st and have 9lbs of bone; that I am slightly fat, 64% water and 8% nachos. OK, not that last one.) \u201cYou are standard,\u201d the proper readout reveals. \u201cWith little muscle.\u201d</p> <p>None of this is a healthy way for anyone to think of themselves. Body fat and basal metabolic rate may be interesting to gym bunnies, but should we care what our muscle mass, bone weight or water percentage is? You are not training for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/11/robots-and-reconstruction-can-tokyo-2020-top-1964s-olympic-legacy\" title=\"\">Tokyo 2020</a>. You can like yourself without those numbers, or hate yourself when you are \u201cwinning\u201d. It is impressive how the scale reads body composition from only an electric current, but frankly it is too much data. Staring at the chasm between yourself and your beauty ideals won\u2019t bring you any closer to achieving them. If x3 magnification isn\u2019t enough, how about x6, or x160?

      "bodyText": "Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who\u2019s the most acne-prone of them all? \u201cRHETORICAL QUESTION LOL\u201d I\u2019m thinking bitterly, staring into this week\u2019s device. HiMirror Mini Premium (\u20ac259 [\u00a3240], himirror.com) is a smart surface that analyses your skin, presenting a breakdown of wrinkles, red spots, dark spots, dark circles, fine lines, pores and roughness. Every day for a week I have been looking into this pitiless oracle \u2013 and the news is never good. I may have hidden depths, but my sallow is all too visible. The mirror keeps flashing up bits of rude advice, telling me to get more calories from peanut butter, or informing me my outer skin \u201closes moisture easily, as it is composed of the oldest and driest cells\u201d. Right to my face. It might as well be calling me Ol\u2019 Wonken Chops. In its favour, HiMirror is technically mesmerising. You line up your face to a virtual mask and it snaps a picture of you to analyse. The mirror is a mirror \u2013 unless you choose to magnify your face by x2 or a horrific x3, in which case it switches to a tablet-style camera in selfie mode. It displays weather and news snippets. (Deeply weird to be given the latest on Kashmir when obsessing over your pores.) You can connect to Spotify and watch beauty tutorials on YouTube. I\u2019m a sucker for this kind of fluid futurism \u2013 and, unlike many overengineered devices, it works beautifully. When I turn it on, a purple sprite formed of bubbles winks at me, as if I\u2019m taking a wee break from reality. By default, the sides of the mirror illuminate in clear white, although they turn warm and orange if you select the \u201cMakeup studio\u201d option. You can even try virtual makeup effects using augmented reality. The interface is stunning. My face, however, is not. It\u2019s hard, being informed how rough you are on a daily basis, that you rate \u201cpoor\u201d for dark spots but \u201caverage\u201d for wrinkles. This information is tracked via projected graphs. The data is meant to indicate whether your skincare regime is working, which many people will love. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the mirror might as well be shouting: \u201cCome get some ham, Fatty Boom-Boom,\u201d first thing in the morning. It gets worse. The company also offers a suite of accessories with which the mirror can communicate \u2013 including the Smart Body scale (\u20ac119, himirror.com). \u201cYou are underfat and with little muscle,\u201d the mirror tells me after they have a little conversation. It flashes up a stick drawing of a man with a tiny arse. I have never been so insulted. It also claims I weigh 6st 12lb (44kg), which can\u2019t be right \u2013 the tureen of chilli I ate last night weighed about that \u2013 yet I spend two days walking around wondering if it\u2019s true. (In fact, I had the scale on a carpet, which threw off the reading. Proper readings, on a hard surface, reveal that I weigh just more than 10st and have 9lbs of bone; that I am slightly fat, 64% water and 8% nachos. OK, not that last one.) \u201cYou are standard,\u201d the proper readout reveals. \u201cWith little muscle.\u201d None of this is a healthy way for anyone to think of themselves. Body fat and basal metabolic rate may be interesting to gym bunnies, but should we care what our muscle mass, bone weight or water percentage is? You are not training for Tokyo 2020. You can like yourself without those numbers, or hate yourself when you are \u201cwinning\u201d. It is impressive how the scale reads body composition from only an electric current, but frankly it is too much data. Staring at the chasm between yourself and your beauty ideals won\u2019t bring you any closer to achieving them. If x3 magnification isn\u2019t enough, how about x6, or x160? If you don\u2019t like yourself, there will always be more ground to make up. From an engineering perspective, HiMirror is extraordinary. You could lose hours with it. Is such a use of time more important than nurturing your abilities and talents? Give me strength. And a bigger arse. No offence to Vince The mirror and the scale both require a mains connection, which is just too much cable. I\u2019m falling over myself, but not to recommend this. Wellness or hellness? Mirrorballs to it all. 2/5",

About 131m cases of the sexually transmitted infection are diagnosed worldwide every year and there have been almost 220,000 new cases in England in 2019. Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics, but the infection often has no symptoms and so many people are unaware they have it. It is described as a \u201chidden epidemic\u201d which, without treatment, can lead to fertility issues and an increased risk of HIV. The findings raise hopes that the jab could eventually be given at the same time as the HPV vaccine, which protects against certain cancers.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>More proof of climate crisis \u2013 </strong>Gases heating the planet in 2018 were higher than humans have ever recorded, according to findings by the American Meteorological Society and the US government.

The global annual average for carbon dioxide \u2013 elevated by activities such as driving cars and burning fuel \u2013 was 407.4 parts per million, 2.4 ppm higher than in 2017. Last year was the fourth-warmest on record since the mid- to late-1800s, while sea levels were the highest on record as global heating melted land-based ice and expanded oceans.

The Briefing\u2019s picks: the one about free-range chicken, followed closely by estate agent. * * * Chlamydia shot works \u2013 The first ever vaccine against chlamydia has been deemed safe in a clinical trial. About 131m cases of the sexually transmitted infection are diagnosed worldwide every year and there have been almost 220,000 new cases in England in 2019. Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics, but the infection often has no symptoms and so many people are unaware they have it. It is described as a \u201chidden epidemic\u201d which, without treatment, can lead to fertility issues and an increased risk of HIV. The findings raise hopes that the jab could eventually be given at the same time as the HPV vaccine, which protects against certain cancers. * * * More proof of climate crisis \u2013 Gases heating the planet in 2018 were higher than humans have ever recorded, according to findings by the American Meteorological Society and the US government. Greenhouse gas levels exceeded 60 years of modern measurements and 800,000 years of ice core data, according to data collected by more than 470 scientists in 60 countries. The global annual average for carbon dioxide \u2013 elevated by activities such as driving cars and burning fuel \u2013 was 407.4 parts per million, 2.4 ppm higher than in 2017. Last year was the fourth-warmest on record since the mid- to late-1800s, while sea levels were the highest on record as global heating melted land-based ice and expanded oceans. Sea surface temperatures were also near a record high while the extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea was near a record low and glaciers continued to melt and lose mass for the 30th consecutive year. * * * Canada suspects died by suicide \u2013 The triple-murder suspects Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky killed themselves, police have said after autopsies. Their bodies were found in the bushland of Canada\u2019s Manitoba province after a weeks-long manhunt. They are blamed for the deaths of American Chynna Deese, Australian Lucas Fowler, and of Leonard Dyck, a Canadian botanist. Police are investigating a photograph of Nazi paraphernalia allegedly sent online by Schmegelsky. * * * Stink on the Northern line \u2013 If you are plunging into London\u2019s Kennington station today you might want to hold your nose. Mystery surrounds a strange odour that hangs in the air, described by some as smelling like sick, and by others as redolent of Burger King. In typical underground-ese, Transport for London said: \u201cWe apologise to customers who may have experienced an unpleasant smell at Kennington tube station recently. We are investigating the cause and will work to remove it as quickly as we can.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Crisis in Kashmir Azhar Farooq and Vidhi Doshi report on the consequences of the Indian government\u2019s decision to impose direct rule on Kashmir from Delhi. Plus, Jason Burke on life in post-Mugabe Zimbabwe. Lunchtime read: High stakes of remain game A week after Britain voted to leave the European Union, tens of thousands of people massed in Parliament Square \u2013 draped in the EU flag or wearing it as warpaint on their faces. \u201cA new movement had been born: remainism,\u201d writes Daniel Cohen. \u201cRemainists feel embattled, ignored; they lament what their country has become \u2013 the kinds of sentiments more usually associated with leavers. \u201cThey used to pride themselves on their moderation; now, spurred on by rage, they divide the world into enemies and allies. What they are doing is loud, obsessive, tribal, confrontational \u2013 politics, in other words. Their fundamental demand \u2013 stopping Brexit \u2013 is now firmly in the mainstream. But with Boris Johnson in No.10 and 31 October approaching, the remainists are running out of time.\u201d Separately, John Denham argues that for the sake of Britain\u2019s own union, the \u201cEnglish interest\u201d needs to be separated from ugly English nationalism. \u201cEnglish-identifying voters are the least satisfied with their political representation and are unlikely to feel Westminster understands them. They want English laws made by English MPs, and many would like a parliament for England. Certainly, if the union is to survive, English voters need to be convinced of its modern relevance just as much as voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\u201d Sport Eddie Jones has admitted he is powerless to stop England\u2019s problem with off-field indiscipline after omitting Ben Te\u2019o from his World Cup squad following his altercation with Mike Brown at a recent training camp in Treviso. England paceman Jofra Archer has insisted on the eve of his Test debut at Lord\u2019s on Wednesday that he is ready for the five-day challenge and warned Australia not to doubt his stamina. Anthony Joshua is \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with staging his heavyweight title rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr in Saudi Arabia, despite growing criticism from human rights organisations, and does not believe it will damage his reputation, his manager Eddie Hearn has said. The rocky alliance between Suzann Pettersen and the Solheim Cup continues after the Norwegian was surprisingly handed a wildcard pick for the European team seeking to win back the trophy next month at Gleneagles. Andy Murray\u2019s return to singles action after a seven-month absence ended in defeat in Cincinnati and the 32-year-old confirmed he would not consider playing singles at the US Open. And barely two weeks after winning $3m at the Fortnite World Cup, Kyle \u201cBugha\u201d Giersdorf was \u201cswatted\u201d in the middle of a livestreaming session. Business Asian stock markets have followed Wall Street lower amid anxiety the US-Chinese trade war will hurt already slowing global economic growth. Meanwhile investors were rattled by a Chinese government statement saying protests in Hong Kong showed signs of \u201cterrorism\u201d. Beijing\u2019s use of the term terrorism \u201ctriggered a wave of risk aversion across global markets,\u201d said a VM Markets report. The FTSE is very slightly higher ahead of the opening bell while the pound is trading at $1.206 and \u20ac1.078. The papers Several papers carry pictures of Boris Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, at their first official engagement inside No 10. The Telegraph\u2019s accompanying headline is \u201cPublic backs Johnson to shut down Parliament for Brexit\u201d, quoting a poll that suggests voters want to exit on 31 October by any means. The Times has the same photo with the headline \u201cUS promises fast-track trade deals after Brexit\u201d. The Mail also carries the photo of the new couple in No 10, but it\u2019s splash is \u201cBan hands-free calls in the car\u201d. The i leads on that story too: \u201cHands-free car phone crackdown planned\u201d. The Guardian splashes on \u201cNational Grid accused as series of blackout near-misses revealed\u201d and also carries a picture of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, with the headline: \u201cFocus turns to British socialite\u201d. The Mirror and the Express both have stories on Nigel Farage: \u201cStorm over Farage\u2019s vile attack on royal family\u201d is the Mirror\u2019s headline. The Express has \u201cFury over Farage\u2019s scathing rant at the Royal Family\u201d, but the paper saves its splash for \u201cShocking rise in police assaults\u201d, reporting 23 attacks a day on officers in a \u201ccrime epidemic\u201d.
