Earlier, Craig Overton had finished with five for 31 after finishing off Warwickshire\u2019s first innings for 135, before Liam Norwell, making his Championship debut for Warwickshire, ignited, pocketing seven for 41. An unbeaten 36 from Overton, and a waggle from the tail, took Somerset to 164 having at one point been 78 for seven.</p> <p>On the Isle of Wight, <strong>Hampshire</strong> finished on top after bowling out <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> for 239, a first-innings deficit of 71. Captain Steven Mullaney\u2019s 102 helped inch them towards respectability from 72 for five with Tom Moores and the tail. There were three wickets for Kyle Abbott, Fidel Edwards and Keith Barker.</p> <p><strong>Kent</strong> went from parity to paucity, after losing eight for 67, as the shadows grew long at Beckenham. There were three wickets apiece for the old timers, Rikki Clarke and Gareth Batty, who just missed out on a hat-trick, and three for young spaniel Sam Curran in his first Championship match of the season. All this despite a century from Sean Dickson at the top of the order. <strong>Surrey</strong> were 11 for none at the close, a lead of 156. Earlier Clarke had guided Surrey\u2019s first innings past 400 before being last man out for 88.</p> <p>In Division Two another 14 wickets fell at Old Trafford as the top-of-the-table clash scurried towards a result. In a topsy-turvy game, <strong>Worcestershire</strong> finished 149 for nine as Wayne Parnell fell to the last ball of the day, a lead of 120. Earlier <strong>Lancashire</strong> had limped to 201, despite a 98-run sixth-wicket stand between Dane Vilas and Liam Livingstone. Livingstone, never one to dally, hit Ed Barnard for five successive boundaries, to pass fifty, but when Vilas fell soon afterwards, Lancashire lost five for 15 to be all out on the stroke of sandwiches. Wayne Parnell took five for 47.</p> <p>Chris Jordan and Ben Brown\u2019s epic partnership of 309 at Northampton eventually came to an end when Brown was lbw to Luke Wood for 156. Jordan (166) followed as <strong>Sussex</strong> were bowled out for 422, with three wickets apiece for Ben Sanderson and Jamie Overton. Despite a second-wicket partnership of 137 between Ricardo Vasconcelos and Josh Cobb, a mid-innings wobble stymied <strong>Northamptonshire\u2019s</strong> reply, finishing 242 for six.</p> <p>It was another dismal day for <strong>Durham</strong> at the Riverside where <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> had them on the frayed end of the rope. The visitors\u2019 bowlers sliced through Durham\u2019s batting \u2013 a five-duck affair \u2013 Josh Shaw the pick with three for 31. Gloucester need 53 more runs to win with nine wickets in hand.</p> <p>On day three at the County Ground, the <strong>Glamorgan</strong> lower order wriggled to 346, Ravi Rampaul taking five for 94. <strong>Derbyshire</strong> struggled to 171 for nine thanks to 47 from Wayne Madsen, a lead of 203.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-05-21T18:59:21.829Z\">at 7.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ce440808f08cb6183373626\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-05-21T18:18:00.117Z\">7.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Goodbye from Old Trafford, </strong>where on the pitch seven men are doing things with hoses.

      "bodyText": "Somerset had victory in their nostrils at Taunton, after 19 wickets toppled on the second day. Warwickshire limped off the field in the evening shadows at 103 for six, needing a further 136 to win; Sam Hain\u2019s unbeaten 43 a batting high point. Earlier, Craig Overton had finished with five for 31 after finishing off Warwickshire\u2019s first innings for 135, before Liam Norwell, making his Championship debut for Warwickshire, ignited, pocketing seven for 41. An unbeaten 36 from Overton, and a waggle from the tail, took Somerset to 164 having at one point been 78 for seven. On the Isle of Wight, Hampshire finished on top after bowling out Nottinghamshire for 239, a first-innings deficit of 71. Captain Steven Mullaney\u2019s 102 helped inch them towards respectability from 72 for five with Tom Moores and the tail. There were three wickets for Kyle Abbott, Fidel Edwards and Keith Barker. Kent went from parity to paucity, after losing eight for 67, as the shadows grew long at Beckenham. There were three wickets apiece for the old timers, Rikki Clarke and Gareth Batty, who just missed out on a hat-trick, and three for young spaniel Sam Curran in his first Championship match of the season. All this despite a century from Sean Dickson at the top of the order. Surrey were 11 for none at the close, a lead of 156. Earlier Clarke had guided Surrey\u2019s first innings past 400 before being last man out for 88. In Division Two another 14 wickets fell at Old Trafford as the top-of-the-table clash scurried towards a result. In a topsy-turvy game, Worcestershire finished 149 for nine as Wayne Parnell fell to the last ball of the day, a lead of 120. Earlier Lancashire had limped to 201, despite a 98-run sixth-wicket stand between Dane Vilas and Liam Livingstone. Livingstone, never one to dally, hit Ed Barnard for five successive boundaries, to pass fifty, but when Vilas fell soon afterwards, Lancashire lost five for 15 to be all out on the stroke of sandwiches. Wayne Parnell took five for 47. Chris Jordan and Ben Brown\u2019s epic partnership of 309 at Northampton eventually came to an end when Brown was lbw to Luke Wood for 156. Jordan (166) followed as Sussex were bowled out for 422, with three wickets apiece for Ben Sanderson and Jamie Overton. Despite a second-wicket partnership of 137 between Ricardo Vasconcelos and Josh Cobb, a mid-innings wobble stymied Northamptonshire\u2019s reply, finishing 242 for six. It was another dismal day for Durham at the Riverside where Gloucestershire had them on the frayed end of the rope. The visitors\u2019 bowlers sliced through Durham\u2019s batting \u2013 a five-duck affair \u2013 Josh Shaw the pick with three for 31. Gloucester need 53 more runs to win with nine wickets in hand. On day three at the County Ground, the Glamorgan lower order wriggled to 346, Ravi Rampaul taking five for 94. Derbyshire struggled to 171 for nine thanks to 47 from Wayne Madsen, a lead of 203. Goodbye from Old Trafford, where on the pitch seven men are doing things with hoses. Wickets, wickets at Taunton and OT, and more intrigue everywhere in the morning - till then, good evening! Division One Taunton: Somerset 209 &amp; 164 (Norwell 7-41), Warwickshire 135 (C Overton 5-31) &amp; 103-6. Warwickshire need 136 runs to win Beckenham: Kent 294 (Dickson 128), Surrey 439 (Jacks 120) &amp; 11-0. Surrey lead by 156 runs Newport: Hampshire 310 &amp; 3-1, Nottinghamshire 239 (Mullaney 102). Hampshire lead by 74 runs Division Two Northampton: Northants 242-6, Sussex 422 (Jordan 166, Brown 156). Northants trail Sussex by 180 runs Old Trafford: Lancashire 201 (Parnell 5-47), Worcestershire 172 (Anderson 5-25) &amp; 149-9. Worcs lead by 120 runs Riverside: Durham 158 &amp; 132, Gloucestershire 174 &amp; 64-1. Gloucs need 53 runs to win Derby: Derbyshire 378 &amp; 162-9 (Reece 111), Glamorgan 346 (Rampaul 5-94). Derbyshire lead by 194 runs [latest score]. Northants wobbling, as Bavuma and Cobb follow in quick succession. 185/4 and in a game that may be over tonight - Gloucester chase 117 to win at The Riverside. I\u2019ll leave you to monitor it BTL, pls excuse me whilst I write up. A good day for the Overton\u2019s - as Hose goes for 4, Warwicks 55-4. Dickson passes 100 - he scored 300 plus at this ground two years ago , but Surrey have got this sorted. Gareth Batty 3-40 Sibley gone! Leach the man, Gregory the catcher, for 24. Warwicks 55/3. Smart catch. Worcestershire are in trouble. And John Gwynne, the OT ground announcer for this season, thinks he knows why. He watched James Anderson in discussion with Dane Vilas, before Vilas waved at Gleeson and indicated that he should switch ends. Since then, he\u2019s taken three wickets - Worcs 82/6. DIVISION ONE Hampshire v Notts: Hampshire 310 (Weatherley 66, Donald 46; Fletcher 4-79); Nottinghamshire 166/8 (Mullaney 43 not out; Abbott 3-41, Barker 3-46). Kent v Surrey: Surrey 439 (Borthwick 95, Jacks 120, Clarke 88; Mulder 4-118); Kent 203-2 (Dickson 94 not out, Crawley 54) (not tea)Somerset v Warwickshire: Somerset 209 (Extras 47) and 164 (Norwell 4-24); Hannon-Dalby 5-18) and 164 (Craig OVerton 36 not out; Norwell 7-41); Warwickshire 135 (Sibley 26, Banks 26; C Overton 5-31) and 37/2 (Sibley 17 not out) DIVISION TWO (day 3) Derbyshire v Glamorgan: Derby 378 (Reece 111, Hughes 82; Carey 4-61) and 64/1; Glamorgan 346 (Hemphrey 75, Root 68; Rampaul 5-94) Durham v Gloucesteshire: Durham 158( Burnham 43, Raine 42; Payne 4-40) and 111/6 (Bancroft 40; Shaw 3-31); Gloucestershire 174 (Rushworth 3-39, Carse 3-51, Salisbury 3-30) Lancashire v Worcestershire: Worcestershire 172 (Parnell 63; Anderson 5-25, Onions 3-52) and 76-4 (Fell 39 not out); Lancashire 201 (Livingstone 69; Parnell 5-47, Morris 4-52) Northamptonshire v Sussex: Sussex 422 (Brown 156, Jordan 166 not out; Sanderson 3-78; J Overton 3-79); Northants 143/2 (Vasconcelos 83) And that\u2019s tea! Scores to follow. For you CB: Notts: Abbott, Barker, Abbott, Abbott, Barker... Edwards....Barker, Edwards. Notts 159/8 after losing 3-8. Kent have lost a wicket - Bell-Drummond for 37. 1917/2. The wickets have gone to the old-timers Batty and Clarke. Is this a coincidence on a pitch that screams \u201cbe patient?\u201d The good news is Sibley\u2019s still there....Warwickshire 26/2. Oh dear, oh dear, Worcestershire. Wessels, a two ball duck, very much lbw to Gleeson. Can their tail wag again to such jolly effect? Durham 97 for 6 - Payne is a Shaw thing when playing Gloucestershire. Ahem. Durham lead by 81 at The Riverside. Bailey on the button And now Gleeson! Well caught by Livingstone at second slip- Ferguson trudges off for a duck. And so it begins as it will surely end...Warwickshire 4/1. Rhodes gone for a duck. A wicket for Lewis Gregory. And after much playing and missing, oohing and ahing, Worcestershire lose their second wicket for 50, Rhodes for 26. Tom Bailey removing his middle stump with one that nipped back. Jim is bored on the train: Somerset all out 164. Liam Norwell 7-41. Warwickshire need 239 to win. I\u2019d say their chances are zero. Don\u2019t hate me. Durham have recovered from 0/0 to 75-4, Josh Shaw 3-18. And Glamorgan all out 346 - trailing Derbyshire by 32. Rampauls 5-94. Northants 78-1 following Sussex\u2019s 422. Just realised that Ben Curran, brother of Tom and Sam, has won his chance, but out for just 3 after 12 balls. It could be a long and miserable wait in the dressing-room as his teammates make hay. Notts 106/5: Abbott, Barker, Abbott, Abbott, Barker. Zak Crawley out at Beckenham, for 104 ball 63, shame, but Dickson and Bell-Drummond bat on, setting sail for tomorrow lunchtime. Kent 151 for 1. Somerset, gosh, pass the hundred - 116/8 thanks to Craig Overton, Groenewald, and Davey. Lead now 194; Norwell 6-35. How the Caribbean is affected by the climate crisis Gary Naylor is thinking statistics Wonderful Matthew Engel on the World Cup, in which he channels King Lear and uses the word \u201cratshit\u201d At lunch I stood by the side of the pavilion and watched people shuffle by, digging into their pockets for change for a classic magnum, and then watched the players walk out. And had a thought. Championship Cricket makes cricketers more gentle than they otherwise would be. Cricketers are fine physical specimens; Championship watchers, and I mean this in the kindest possible way, and include myself in the description, verge on the oddball. In what other space would they rub together? Back from my perambulation. Anderson back on action-repeat, Mitchell caught behind after getting an edge on one that rose a little more rapidly than expected. Worcestershire 8 for 1. DIVISION ONE Hampshire v Notts: Hampshire 310 (Weatherley 66, Donald 46; Fletcher 4-79); Nottinghamshire 55-2. Kent v Surrey: Surrey 439 (Borthwick 95, Jacks 120, Clarke 88; Mulder 4-118); Kent 106-0 (Crawley 54) Somerset v Warwickshire: Somerset 209 (Extras 47) and 75-5 (Norwell 4-24); Hannon-Dalby 5-18); Warwickshire 135 (Sibley 26, Banks 26; C Overton 5-31) DIVISION TWO (day 3) Derbyshire v Glamorgan: Derby 378 (Reece 111, Hughes 82; Carey 4-61) Glamorgan 299-6 (Hemphrey 75, Root 68) Durham v Gloucesteshire: Durham 158( Burnham 43, Raine 42; Payne 4-40) and 39-2; Gloucestershire 174 (Rushworth 3-39, Carse 3-51, Salisbury 3-30) Lancashire v Worcestershire: Worcestershire 172 (Parnell 63; Anderson 5-25, Onions 3-52); Lancashire 201 (Livingstone 69; Parnell 5-47, Morris 4-52) Northamptonshire v Sussex: Sussex 422 (Brown 156, Jordan 166 not out; Sanderson 3-78; J Overton 3-79); Northants 15-1 I\u2019d missed this - Mason Crane replaced Liam Dawson at Hampshire because of Dawson\u2019s inclusion in the World Cup squad. And that\u2019s lunch at OT, with Onions caught for four, just after grabbing a batting point. Lancashire lost 5-15 in a rather hopeless half hour. Their lead? 27. Parnell 5-47, Morris 4-52. Lunch-time scores to follow. Here is Norwell, a \u201cchampionship specialist\u201d according to cricinfo. And that\u2019s the ninth Lancashire wicket, Livingstone bowled neck, crop, ankle, by Parnell for 69 - Lancs 195/9, a lead of 23. .... Tres out for 23; Norwell 4-24. Somerset now 68/5.... A lunchtime Lancs-up: 191/8, Bailey c Barnard b Morris 2. And thanks for the reminder BTL WashingonIrving, I did read yesterday that the Taunton pitch was very green. Do you remember, back in April when Ed Smith was talking about the decline of the public intellectual? I can\u2019t remember the context now but I\u2019m sure it was something to do with cricket and there was a brief discussion BTL. Anyway, if you\u2019re interested Ed, or anyone, - this looks great! (Oh and Lancs lose another wicket, Croft for a duck. 187/7) Er, head abuzz: Durham 8/1, Somerset 55/4, Notts 40/2. Sussex all out 422, three for JOverton and Sanderson. But not much to say about Glamorgan, quietly clawing their way to parity. 260/6. Abhijato Sensarma writes in: \u201cBeing gutted is the most natural response when what could have potentially been the biggest moments of your career is snatched away from you, but your immediate reaction to it defines your sportsmanship. \u201cWhile I hope nothing but the best for both him [Willey] and Rayudu in the future, the latter had quite a different and much talked about response to his dropping from the World Cup squad, which one can both read too much or too less into at the same time. \u201c In all honesty, though, I must say that the \u20183D glasses\u2019 joke was a classic on-field sledge from Rayudu. He may have retired from first-class cricket but if he displays such skulls more often, surely we can get him into the Indian Test slip cordon, beside Pant perhaps? ;)\u201c And then, after a merry partnership of 98 inside 19 overs, Vilas decides to leave a ball that travels happily along to knock out his stumps. Lancs 186-6. OHH!HH! A furious Barnard drops Livingstone on 63 from the last ball of the over - a sharp caught and bowled by his knee cap. He kicks the air in fury. And that\u2019s four fours in a row from Livingstone off Ed Barnard - the second brought him fifty, the fourth, a cover drive, gave Lancashire the lead (2). And that\u2019s a fifth! (6) Gloucestershire all out 174 - a lead of 16, three each for Rushworth, Carse and Salisbury. So a one-innings shoot out on the cards at The Riverside. Should Liam Livingstone go from 47 to 50, it would be his first half century in first class cricket since September 2017 and there it is! David Willey: 100% decent human being Two ducks in Somerset\u2019s second innings - Hildreth and Azhar. Liam Norwell 2-4. I was assuming it was Warwickshire\u2019s useless batting, but perhaps there is something in the pitch? Or maybe, as mentioned BTL, Hildreth is in a bit of a slump - averaging 32.35 in fc this year, Azhar Ali 24, Tres 7.25. So, indulge me. My maternal grandparents, Amber and Desmond, met on the Isle of Wight on holiday, and my grandfather proposed to my grandmother in a field with a grass engagement ring when she was about 14. Various generations have holidayed there ever since - and that short crossing over the solent always feels like a bridge to something removed, something other. We\u2019re missing Paul Edwards in the box today - but you can capture some of the Isle of Wight magic here. Fifty partnership here at OT between Vilas and Livingstone, 68 balls, 50 mins. Kent 13 without loss against Surrey\u2019s impressive 439 Oh, and Hampshire all out for 310! After losing 4-15, Fletcher 4-79. Jordan\u2019s out at last - 166 which isn\u2019t bad as an up your to Ed Smith - except he\u2019s too nice to do that. Sussex 404-8, two wickets for t\u2019other Overton. Gloucestershire 151-8, trailing Durham by 7. Afghanistan 77-1 off 14 v Ireland; Sri Lanka 34/0 off 7 v Scotland. Shhh, tiny writing, Marcus Trescothick has two fours in his 8 not out as Somerset bat again. And then the scorecard flicks to 8/1. And then I click... and Azhar is out. As you were. Somedays... Warwickshire\u2019s batting turns in another command performance, 135 all out. Coverton 5-31. While I\u2019ve been faffing about with links here and there, plus making use of the press box\u2019s repaired coffee machine - Lancashire are actually doing pretty well, putting on 38 in the first half hour. Six fours in Livingstone\u2019s 32, and four in Vilas\u2019s 21. This, x100. Terribly poignant tweet from Graham. Without wishing ill on anyone else, hope Willey still has a part to play. Surrey all out 439 - Mulder 4-118. Your turn Kent. Brown\u2019s been out for 156 at Northants, Sussex 377/7 and Gloucester lose Howell (27), 127/6. A busy couple of overs at Taunton as Warwickshire lose two in two without adding a run - 110-9. Leach now 2-3. Give it back you miserable sod! And Tom Harrison\u2019s pay packet news. (Just looked up Theresa May\u2019s out of interest, \u00a3153,907) Elsewhere, as expected, David Willey and Joe Denly are axed from England\u2019s World Cup squad, with Jofra Archer, Liam Dawson and James Vince (for Alex Hales) coming in. Hello from Old Trafford where the sun is out, the roller is being pushed hither and thither and big fluffy white clouds prowl the sky. They\u2019re kinda cute, but whether they are cute enough for Worcestershire\u2019s bowlers to get the sort of help Anderson and Onions got yesterday, we wait to see. Lancs are in a bit of a tricky situation at 88 for 5, as are Warwickshire, 110-7, and Gloucestershire 120-5. Runs aplenty at Beckenham, Surrey 420-9 and Northants where Jordan and Brown may go on forever, Sussex 370-6. It\u2019s even stevens at Hampshire, Hants 288-6, and Derbyshire, Glamorgan 214-4.",

      "body": "<p>Three weeks before last Christmas, a shaggy jumble of an email flopped into my inbox. \u201cOdd request,\u201d it began. \u201cFeel free to ignore if it makes no sense/is a load of old cobblers.\u201d</p> <p>It came from a publicist for Underworld. The electronic-music duo were \u201ccollating lists of things/people/places and then taking them into the studio to create music\u201d, he wrote. Having seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/the-alternatives\" title=\"\">The alternatives</a>, my series of Guardian columns about how to make the economy work for everyone, he \u201cwondered if there was a list of inspirational people/ideas/processes that could be easily scribbled down\u201d. No windy sentences or long explanations, \u201cjust 10-20 things to act as triggers in the studio\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/underworld\" title=\"\">Underworld</a>! You know the name, even if all it brings back is that bit in Trainspotting when the soundtrack goes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9ZNKGrpnKM\" title=\"\">\u201cLager </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9ZNKGrpnKM\" title=\"\">lager </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9ZNKGrpnKM\" title=\"\">lager </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9ZNKGrpnKM\" title=\"\">lager\u201d</a>. For me, however, Underworld means tramping around as a teenager with crumpled notes earned in a Saturday job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zR4oXiFDxE\" title=\"\">searching out their earliest 12-inches</a>. It means some of the most splendid and determinedly wayward British music to be labelled techno. So, the email was off the wall, and music people can be flakier than a 99 cone, but I thought: where is the harm in jotting down a few random phrases and bunging them off into the ether?</p> <p>It took about 10 minutes: typed, emailed, laptop closed. Then all was forgotten in the pell-mell of Brexmas.</p> <p>Scroll forward to a honeyed morning in the middle of last week. I am deep in the bit of north Essex that minds its consonants and pretends it is Cambridge, down a dirt track in a converted pig shed surrounded by fields. This complex of former farm outhouses is Underworld HQ, with rooms devoted to old equipment, records and what looks like an entire wall of coiled cables. Sitting on either side of me around a long, black table, Rick Smith and Karl Hyde explain what happened when they received my reply.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_c0cnV5hGk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D_c0cnV5hGk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the video for Soniamode (Aditya Game Version).</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Observer has dubbed them \u201celectronic heroes\u201d, but the pair who live in this rolling countryside display relaxed courtesy. (They didn\u2019t instigate this interview \u2013 I suggested it.) Even with his bleached-blond hair and zesty-green shirt, Hyde \u2013 the singer \u2013 gives only flashes of his onstage puckishness. Smith \u2013 the producer \u2013 is tall and crowned with grey, looking like the encouraging headmaster of an Anglican primary.</p> <p>Out of Smith\u2019s laptop surges a bassline, the signature that announces: \u201cHello! We are Underworld,\u201d even to people who haven\u2019t checked in on them for two decades.

They have been making music together for four decades and now they want to shake the bottle and wake the drink \u2013 to work fast and seek out what Smith says are \u201cthe collaborations and chance encounters that are fundamental to every artist\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt grew out of boredom,\u201d says Hyde. \u201cBoredom with the old cycle of lead track/single/album/tour and then, three years later, lead track/single/album \u2013 with a three-week window for publicity.

What are \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/07/corporate-welfare-a-93bn-handshake\" title=\"\">corporate welfare queens</a>\u2019?\u201d What should have been a writing session in the studio turned into a reading marathon. \u201cI went through years of your work, especially The alternatives. \u2018Oh my goodness! These people have done that.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why did I go 'Lager lager lager lager'? Because I lost my place on the page</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is one big thing Underworld share with many of the people I wrote about for The alternatives: they are ahead of their peers and slightly out of step with them. In a music industry that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/apr/16/arts-industry-report-asks-where-are-all-the-working-class-people\" title=\"\">overwhelmingly metropolitan and middle class</a>, their origins are small-town working class. Brought up in Ammanford, half an hour\u2019s drive from Swansea, Smith worked previously as a bank clerk in Llanelli. His dad was a toolmaker, a salesman and a lay pastor, while his mum taught piano. Hyde was brought up in Bewdley, Worcestershire. His dad worked in a carpet factory in nearby Kidderminster, where his mum ran a dry cleaners\u2019 shop.</p> <p>The pair met as students in Cardiff while working in a burger bar. The music they made for the next decade was more about trying to tickle the charts than channelling Kraftwerk, Neu! and the other German bands they loved. Their reward was to be dropped by their record label. It was then that they started making their oddly charismatic electronic music, but they remained determinedly marginal, dropping anchor not in London but in Romford, Essex, and refusing to pump out endless remakes of Born Slippy. As an Essex cabbie once lamented to Hyde, they could have been the Prodigy; part of their magic is that they stubbornly preferred to remain Underworld.</p> <p>In the past few years, they have started campaigning about homelessness. They launched <a href=\"https://mcrstreetpoem.com\" title=\"\">Manchester Street Poem</a>, a soundtracked installation telling the stories of local homeless people, at the Manchester international festival in 2017. It is an award-winning project with which Hyde, in particular, remains involved.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about community. Some of our colleagues, who are former rough sleepers, said: just stop and talk,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we asked: do you know who that is? That\u2019s Sandra and that\u2019s Kevin \u2013 and did you know Kevin used to be a bank manager and Sandra had children who were taken off her? And the number of people who get in touch and say: \u2018That could have been me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hyde thinks stories of community organising should be on the news, \u201cbut what we get instead is that we\u2019d better be really scared and blame Them. Who\u2019s Them? Anybody but me. My father reads a particular paper that fills him with a particular opinion.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d125aa806733cfe4e75595bdf1b340df00b3d420\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d125aa806733cfe4e75595bdf1b340df00b3d420/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Underworld perform in Manchester in July 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Underworld performing in Manchester in July 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Benge/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is it the Daily Mail?</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p> <p>(It is clearly the Mail.)</p> <p>\u201cHe used to buy it and I\u2019d say: \u2018Don\u2019t leave it for my kids to see, please.\u2019 I\u2019d rather he left porn.\u201d</p> <p>But you two came through the rave scene, I say, with all its legends of football hooligans setting aside their blood feuds and getting on one: didn\u2019t that movement promise we would all come together?</p> <p>\u201cThese people didn\u2019t beat each other up and girls weren\u2019t getting hit on and the cultural differences went out of the window,\u201d concedes Hyde.</p> <p>But those were also days of poverty. \u201cI remember that feeling of being one pay cheque away from homelessness,\u201d Smith says. \u201cWanting to look after my family, desperately needing to earn money.\u201d They would borrow \u00a3600 to print up some records that Smith would stick in the back of his mother-in-law\u2019s Ford Fiesta and try to flog to record shops in Soho.</p> <p>Decades later, they have done everything: played up mountains and in castles, jammed for 15 hours straight in a field at Glastonbury, scored films and gold discs. They have two children each. Smith is about to enter his seventh decade, while Hyde turned 62 a few days ago. \u201cWe were in the Yorkshire Dales at the weekend, doing <a href=\"https://www.threepeakschallenge.uk/yorkshire-three-peaks-challenge/\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.threepeakschallenge.uk/yorkshire-three-peaks-challenge/\" title=\"\">Three </a><a href=\"https://www.threepeakschallenge.uk/yorkshire-three-peaks-challenge/\" title=\"\">Peaks </a><a href=\"https://www.threepeakschallenge.uk/yorkshire-three-peaks-challenge/\" title=\"\">Challenge</a>, and as I was coming down the second hill I felt something go and said: \u2018I won\u2019t do the third, thank you very much.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Over Underworld\u2019s 40 years together, the music industry has gone from vinyl to MP3, from labels sustaining a wide range of artists by means of intricate cross-subsidy to billions for the likes of Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift and pennies for the rest. It is a place that has less space and attention, even for bands of Underworld\u2019s stature. Where do they see themselves in today\u2019s industry? \u201cIn this pig shed, under a beautiful sky,\u201d says Hyde. They are constructing an alternative with their collaborators: Malcolm the studio boss, Mike the manager and Robin the publicist.</p> <p>Then Alecsandra, the Guardian\u2019s photographer, starts taking pictures \u2013 and these thoughtful, self-questioning men suddenly turn into the band. Firing up his giant mixing desk, Smith begins improvising a version of Soniamode, hitting buttons marked Zombie Economics, Zombie Government and Addictive Drums. Bouncing around, Hyde puts on a falsetto: \u201cDrop the kick drum, Rick, you\u2019re so great!\u201d</p> <p>Smith obliges, to acclaim from helium Hyde: \u201cHe really is the god of techno! He walks among us.\u201d</p> <p>Then Smith starts looping my words over the Underworld classic Cowgirl, which suddenly I remember playing on my broken Sony midi hi-fi. \u201cOy-yoy-yoy-yoy,\u201d sings Hyde absent-mindedly, as if down the local where an old favourite has just come on. How does he feel when he performs this now? A big grin. \u201cVery often, I feel grateful still to be alive.\u201d</p> <p><em>Soniamode (Aditya Game Version) by Underworld is released on 21 May. <a href=\"https://underworld.lnk.to/aditya\">It can be streamed on various platforms here</a>.

      "bodyText": "Three weeks before last Christmas, a shaggy jumble of an email flopped into my inbox. \u201cOdd request,\u201d it began. \u201cFeel free to ignore if it makes no sense/is a load of old cobblers.\u201d It came from a publicist for Underworld. The electronic-music duo were \u201ccollating lists of things/people/places and then taking them into the studio to create music\u201d, he wrote. Having seen The alternatives, my series of Guardian columns about how to make the economy work for everyone, he \u201cwondered if there was a list of inspirational people/ideas/processes that could be easily scribbled down\u201d. No windy sentences or long explanations, \u201cjust 10-20 things to act as triggers in the studio\u201d. Underworld! You know the name, even if all it brings back is that bit in Trainspotting when the soundtrack goes \u201cLager lager lager lager\u201d. For me, however, Underworld means tramping around as a teenager with crumpled notes earned in a Saturday job searching out their earliest 12-inches. It means some of the most splendid and determinedly wayward British music to be labelled techno. So, the email was off the wall, and music people can be flakier than a 99 cone, but I thought: where is the harm in jotting down a few random phrases and bunging them off into the ether? It took about 10 minutes: typed, emailed, laptop closed. Then all was forgotten in the pell-mell of Brexmas. Scroll forward to a honeyed morning in the middle of last week. I am deep in the bit of north Essex that minds its consonants and pretends it is Cambridge, down a dirt track in a converted pig shed surrounded by fields. This complex of former farm outhouses is Underworld HQ, with rooms devoted to old equipment, records and what looks like an entire wall of coiled cables. Sitting on either side of me around a long, black table, Rick Smith and Karl Hyde explain what happened when they received my reply. The Observer has dubbed them \u201celectronic heroes\u201d, but the pair who live in this rolling countryside display relaxed courtesy. (They didn\u2019t instigate this interview \u2013 I suggested it.) Even with his bleached-blond hair and zesty-green shirt, Hyde \u2013 the singer \u2013 gives only flashes of his onstage puckishness. Smith \u2013 the producer \u2013 is tall and crowned with grey, looking like the encouraging headmaster of an Anglican primary. Out of Smith\u2019s laptop surges a bassline, the signature that announces: \u201cHello! We are Underworld,\u201d even to people who haven\u2019t checked in on them for two decades. He points out each part as it comes in: modular synths, electronic drums, whistles, snatches of jazz piano and \u201ctiny samples of Karl\u2019s voice, which he chopped up himself\u201d. The song, Soniamode, builds into what he calls \u201ca nuts techno New Orleans street band\u201d, overloaded machines seething and restless. On his laptop, he shows a close-up photo of a giant synth, thick cables jammed into its array of holes. \u201cThat is Soniamode.\u201d This was the track as it stood a few months before; now it has extra vocals. When Underworld emerged in the early 90s, dance music either ignored words completely or chose large-lunged positivity. \u201cPeace in the Valley!\u201d declared singers who had obviously never visited Kashmir. What made Hyde so unusual was how cut-up and overheard his lyrics were, like David Bowie sitting at the back of a night bus. Lately, he and Smith have been studying the sticky magic of nursery rhymes, how they spread from place to place and generation to generation. On this track, they try their own version: \u201cBoogie front / Toy toy / Boogie back / Toy toy.\u201d Then, around the halfway mark, everything swings a sharp left: Hyde announces \u201cthe hopeful ideas for the future game\u201d and, in his faint Midlands twang, starts shouting phrases that I last saw in an email five months earlier. \u201cWorkers\u2019 co-ops ... maker spaces ... guerrilla localism ...\u201d Jotting down my pre-Christmas list, I mentioned no people, but four inspiring places: Witney, because of its community-run bus service; Granby, in Liverpool, for its resident-directed housing; Rochdale, the birthplace of England\u2019s co-operative movement; and Preston, where the city council is breaking with a failed economic system. This becomes the chorus: \u201cWitney, Granby, Rochdale, Preston.\u201d Over and over runs the loop. Witney, Granby, Rochdale, Preston. Thanks to this listening exercise, I can report that the universal strangeness of hearing yourself on tape pales next to the absurdity of your words being sung by the voice that soundtracked stretches of your life. Hyde used to bring to my headphones tales from \u201cthe midnight train to Romford\u201d; now he is crooning about employee ownership of businesses. I can\u2019t decide whether this is the high point of my hegemonic ambitions or an out-of-body experience. I wonder, too, if anything approaching this species of bizarreness has befallen other newspaper columnists. Has the Times man Lord Finkelstein submitted the odd verse for Stormzy? Did the Sunday Telegraph doyenne Janet Daley ever chip in the occasional line for Adele? Could whoever among the Economist\u2019s precocious 12-year-olds now writes the Bagehot\u2019s notebook column have helped out Little Mix? I think not. Yet this track today becomes a single that will follow music-industry tradition in being played \u2013 exclusively \u2013 by BBC Radio 6 Music\u2019s champion of off-kilter dance music, Mary Anne Hobbs. It has artwork and a name: Soniamode (Aditya Game Version). It is, in other words, an artefact, just like my 12-inches that, thanks to the arrival of my baby girl, have been Marie Kondoed away. Finished two weeks ago, the single is being released alongside Underworld\u2019s Drift programme of releasing a piece of music and a film every Thursday for a year. They have been making music together for four decades and now they want to shake the bottle and wake the drink \u2013 to work fast and seek out what Smith says are \u201cthe collaborations and chance encounters that are fundamental to every artist\u201d. \u201cIt grew out of boredom,\u201d says Hyde. \u201cBoredom with the old cycle of lead track/single/album/tour and then, three years later, lead track/single/album \u2013 with a three-week window for publicity.

What are \u2018corporate welfare queens\u2019?\u201d What should have been a writing session in the studio turned into a reading marathon. \u201cI went through years of your work, especially The alternatives. \u2018Oh my goodness! These people have done that.\u2019\u201d There is one big thing Underworld share with many of the people I wrote about for The alternatives: they are ahead of their peers and slightly out of step with them.

Smith is about to enter his seventh decade, while Hyde turned 62 a few days ago. \u201cWe were in the Yorkshire Dales at the weekend, doing the Three Peaks Challenge, and as I was coming down the second hill I felt something go and said: \u2018I won\u2019t do the third, thank you very much.\u2019\u201d Over Underworld\u2019s 40 years together, the music industry has gone from vinyl to MP3, from labels sustaining a wide range of artists by means of intricate cross-subsidy to billions for the likes of Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift and pennies for the rest. It is a place that has less space and attention, even for bands of Underworld\u2019s stature. Where do they see themselves in today\u2019s industry? \u201cIn this pig shed, under a beautiful sky,\u201d says Hyde. They are constructing an alternative with their collaborators: Malcolm the studio boss, Mike the manager and Robin the publicist. Then Alecsandra, the Guardian\u2019s photographer, starts taking pictures \u2013 and these thoughtful, self-questioning men suddenly turn into the band. Firing up his giant mixing desk, Smith begins improvising a version of Soniamode, hitting buttons marked Zombie Economics, Zombie Government and Addictive Drums. Bouncing around, Hyde puts on a falsetto: \u201cDrop the kick drum, Rick, you\u2019re so great!\u201d Smith obliges, to acclaim from helium Hyde: \u201cHe really is the god of techno! He walks among us.\u201d Then Smith starts looping my words over the Underworld classic Cowgirl, which suddenly I remember playing on my broken Sony midi hi-fi. \u201cOy-yoy-yoy-yoy,\u201d sings Hyde absent-mindedly, as if down the local where an old favourite has just come on. How does he feel when he performs this now? A big grin. \u201cVery often, I feel grateful still to be alive.\u201d Soniamode (Aditya Game Version) by Underworld is released on 21 May. It can be streamed on various platforms here. Underworld play the Sydney Opera House at Vivid Sydney on 31 May-3 June; and Wembley Arena, London, on 7 December",
