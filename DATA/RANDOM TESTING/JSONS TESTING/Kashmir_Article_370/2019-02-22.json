      "body": "<h2>Top story: Dilemma for PM if ministers back Brexit delay</h2> <p>Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray with a briefing that will have to keep you going until Monday I\u2019m afraid.</p> <p>Theresa May faces a flurry of Commons motions and amendments over Brexit, with up to 25 members of the government prepared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/21/theresa-may-faces-ministerial-revolt-over-no-deal-brexit\">defy the PM and vote for an extension of article 50</a> if she fails to rule out no deal. The motion proposed by the Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper is due to be debated in the coming week and May will be seen as having little option other than to sack ministers if they rebel to support it. The \u201cBrexit delivery group\u201d of 100 MPs from both the remain and leave wings of the party have warned May that many of their number are prepared to rebel unless she allows a free vote on taking no deal off the table.</p> <p>Under another amendment drawn up by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, MPs would support the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal in exchange for it being put to a public vote. It would not be tabled until May brings her final deal back to parliament for the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. If that does not happen next week, May has promised to table another amendable motion, like the one that resulted in her being defeated by Brexit rebels this month. Labour is likely to table its own amendment to that motion, which would put forward Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s alternative Brexit policy.</p> <p>In Brussels, Corbyn \u2013 who this week had eight pro-people\u2019s vote members of his party leave to form the Independent Group \u2013 has made a point of saying that the option of holding a second referendum remains \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/21/starmer-pm-is-running-down-clock-so-mps-only-get-binary-choice\">very much part of the agenda put forward by the Labour party</a>\u201d, should May fail to back a close economic partnership with the EU. Up to 10 Labour shadow ministers have said they would be prepared to resign rather than vote against a second referendum amendment. Some senior party figures believe much of the appeal of the 11-strong Independent Group would be neutralised if Labour leant towards backing a referendum.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Global threat to the human diet \u2013 </strong>About 20% of the Earth\u2019s vegetated surface has become less productive for food over the past 20 years, a UN report says. The comprehensive global study found plants, birds, fish and fungi are in decline as agricultural, urban and industrial development <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/21/worlds-food-supply-under-severe-threat-from-loss-of-biodiversity\">damage the natural support systems that underpin the human diet</a>. As well as the decline of bees and other insects, the Food and Agriculture Organisation report says vertebrate pollinators such as bats and birds are under threat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3224459b20ba4a1668cac033493d871a6ac2adec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3224459b20ba4a1668cac033493d871a6ac2adec/206_0_2469_1482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bee on a sunflower\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not just bees but vertebrate pollinators like birds and bats are under threat, says a UN study.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Agriculture is reliant on monocultures with two-thirds of crops coming from nine species (sugar cane, maize, rice, wheat, potatoes, soybeans, oil-palm fruit, sugar beet and cassava), while many other cultivated plant species are in decline and wild food sources are diminishing. \u201cThe reliance on a small number of species means they are more susceptible to disease outbreaks and climate change. It renders food production less resilient,\u201d warns Julie B\u00e9langer, coordinator of the report.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Murder charge after jihadists\u2019 brother killed \u2013 </strong>Police have charged a man with murdering a brother of two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/man-charged-with-of-jihadists-brother-in-brighton\">British teenagers killed fighting for Islamists in Syria</a>. The convicted drug dealer Abdul Deghayes, 22, from Brighton, died of stab wounds on Sunday after being attacked in a car that crashed in Brighton. Daniel Macleod, 36, of Lambeth, south London, is due to appear before magistrates in Brighton on Friday. The victim\u2019s twin brother, Abdullah, was killed fighting in Syria in 2016 aged 18, while their brother Jaffar, 17, was killed there in 2014.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>North Korea hunger plea \u2013 </strong>North Korea has issued an international call for food aid after drought and floods led to a poor harvest. The UN estimates 10.3 million people \u2013 almost half of North Korea\u2019s population \u2013 are in need of food and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/22/north-korea-appeals-for-food-aid-as-regime-cuts-rations-due-to-drought-and-sanctions\">40% of people in the country are undernourished</a>. North Korea said it faced shortfalls that would lead to daily rations being cut from 550g per person to 300g. The UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said talks were under way with the North Korean government after requests for help via humanitarian agencies. A second summit will be held next week between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>\u2018Punished twice\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The Jamaican high commissioner has called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/21/jamaican-high-commissioner-calls-for-halt-of-deportations-from-uk\">suspension of deportations to Jamaica</a> until the Home Office has published its investigation of the Windrush scandal. \u201cIt is not just the people who are being deported,\u201d said Seth George Ramocan, \u201c it is their children, it is their families. Are we acting intelligently, are we creating another set of problems when we do that?\u201d Ramocan met with relatives of those already deported and others still in immigration removal custody. Family members questioned why people who had been in the UK since childhood should be \u201cpunished twice\u201d by being deported even after serving their prison time for criminal offences. The Jamaican government is understood to be reviewing its cooperation with the Home Office deportation flights in future.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Stone silenced \u2013 </strong>The Republican operative Roger Stone has been slapped with a strict gagging order after he circulated a meme that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/21/roger-stone-trump-ally-judge-slaps-stricter-gag-order\">appeared to threaten the judge in the Trump-Russia case against him</a>. The Donald Trump confidant, who is charged with perjury, witness tampering and obstruction, tried to argue they were not cross-hairs but a \u201cCeltic occult symbol\u201d on the picture of Judge Amy Berman Jackson.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Dilemma for PM if ministers back Brexit delay Hello, it\u2019s Warren Murray with a briefing that will have to keep you going until Monday I\u2019m afraid. Theresa May faces a flurry of Commons motions and amendments over Brexit, with up to 25 members of the government prepared to defy the PM and vote for an extension of article 50 if she fails to rule out no deal. The motion proposed by the Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper is due to be debated in the coming week and May will be seen as having little option other than to sack ministers if they rebel to support it. The \u201cBrexit delivery group\u201d of 100 MPs from both the remain and leave wings of the party have warned May that many of their number are prepared to rebel unless she allows a free vote on taking no deal off the table. Under another amendment drawn up by the Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, MPs would support the prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal in exchange for it being put to a public vote. It would not be tabled until May brings her final deal back to parliament for the \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d. If that does not happen next week, May has promised to table another amendable motion, like the one that resulted in her being defeated by Brexit rebels this month. Labour is likely to table its own amendment to that motion, which would put forward Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s alternative Brexit policy. In Brussels, Corbyn \u2013 who this week had eight pro-people\u2019s vote members of his party leave to form the Independent Group \u2013 has made a point of saying that the option of holding a second referendum remains \u201cvery much part of the agenda put forward by the Labour party\u201d, should May fail to back a close economic partnership with the EU. Up to 10 Labour shadow ministers have said they would be prepared to resign rather than vote against a second referendum amendment. Some senior party figures believe much of the appeal of the 11-strong Independent Group would be neutralised if Labour leant towards backing a referendum. * * * Global threat to the human diet \u2013 About 20% of the Earth\u2019s vegetated surface has become less productive for food over the past 20 years, a UN report says. The comprehensive global study found plants, birds, fish and fungi are in decline as agricultural, urban and industrial development damage the natural support systems that underpin the human diet. As well as the decline of bees and other insects, the Food and Agriculture Organisation report says vertebrate pollinators such as bats and birds are under threat. Agriculture is reliant on monocultures with two-thirds of crops coming from nine species (sugar cane, maize, rice, wheat, potatoes, soybeans, oil-palm fruit, sugar beet and cassava), while many other cultivated plant species are in decline and wild food sources are diminishing. \u201cThe reliance on a small number of species means they are more susceptible to disease outbreaks and climate change. It renders food production less resilient,\u201d warns Julie B\u00e9langer, coordinator of the report. * * * Murder charge after jihadists\u2019 brother killed \u2013 Police have charged a man with murdering a brother of two British teenagers killed fighting for Islamists in Syria. The convicted drug dealer Abdul Deghayes, 22, from Brighton, died of stab wounds on Sunday after being attacked in a car that crashed in Brighton. Daniel Macleod, 36, of Lambeth, south London, is due to appear before magistrates in Brighton on Friday. The victim\u2019s twin brother, Abdullah, was killed fighting in Syria in 2016 aged 18, while their brother Jaffar, 17, was killed there in 2014. * * * North Korea hunger plea \u2013 North Korea has issued an international call for food aid after drought and floods led to a poor harvest. The UN estimates 10.3 million people \u2013 almost half of North Korea\u2019s population \u2013 are in need of food and 40% of people in the country are undernourished. North Korea said it faced shortfalls that would lead to daily rations being cut from 550g per person to 300g. The UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said talks were under way with the North Korean government after requests for help via humanitarian agencies. A second summit will be held next week between Donald Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. * * * \u2018Punished twice\u2019 \u2013 The Jamaican high commissioner has called for a suspension of deportations to Jamaica until the Home Office has published its investigation of the Windrush scandal. \u201cIt is not just the people who are being deported,\u201d said Seth George Ramocan, \u201c it is their children, it is their families. Are we acting intelligently, are we creating another set of problems when we do that?\u201d Ramocan met with relatives of those already deported and others still in immigration removal custody. Family members questioned why people who had been in the UK since childhood should be \u201cpunished twice\u201d by being deported even after serving their prison time for criminal offences. The Jamaican government is understood to be reviewing its cooperation with the Home Office deportation flights in future. * * * Stone silenced \u2013 The Republican operative Roger Stone has been slapped with a strict gagging order after he circulated a meme that appeared to threaten the judge in the Trump-Russia case against him. The Donald Trump confidant, who is charged with perjury, witness tampering and obstruction, tried to argue they were not cross-hairs but a \u201cCeltic occult symbol\u201d on the picture of Judge Amy Berman Jackson. The judge has now banned Stone from making any statements about the case other than to raise money for his defence.
