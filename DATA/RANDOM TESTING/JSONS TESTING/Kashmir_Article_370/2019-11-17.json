      "body": "<p>In the 1990s, Tim Etchells \u2013 an experimental theatre-maker with the Sheffield-based <a href=\"https://www.forcedentertainment.com/\" title=\"\">Forced Entertainment</a> \u2013 wrote a series of scabrous short stories, published as <a href=\"http://timetchells.com/projects/endland-stories/\" title=\"\"><em>Endland: Or Bad Lives</em></a>. Since then, he has intermittently written further tales from the same universe: Endland is a distorted version of England, where social divisions and geopolitical chaos are taken to absurd extremes.</p> <p>All 39 stories are brought together here, with an introduction by Jarvis Cocker. Almost all depict the lives of a deprived underclass. Endland is a place of grotty estates, exploitative jobs and crap pubs. But these urban fables are a world away from dour realism: dragons and ogres feature alongside alcoholics and sex workers. Etchells makes sparks fly by allowing the mythic to rub against grubby everyday existence: there are disruptions to the space-time continuum in Doncaster; Greek gods with names such as Herpes, Apollo 12 and Stormzy drink too much and get caught up in the migrant crisis. This is scorching, bitter satire of how society is continually screwed by inequality.</p> <p>Etchells adopts a vernacular grammar (\u201cthings was going alright\u201d) and homophonic misspellings (hole for whole, nite for night), and a direct, reported style. It\u2019s a cracklingly original voice, and the stories are very funny. Plenty of fun is had with classical allusions: a woman falls so far through the welfare safety net that she ends up in Plato\u2019s cave, while Greek taxi driver Antagonistes is chained behind a Ladbrokes so eagles can nightly feast on his liver. </p> <p>Dipping into <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/endland-9781911508700.html\" title=\"\"><em>Endland</em></a> provides a delightful dose of nastiness. Taken as a whole, however, the collection can seem a little one-note. Sure, references change, so you get Syria rather than Bosnia, Boris Johnson as well as Margaret Thatcher. And Etchells\u2019s fragmented dystopia feels like it has found its moment in the distracted, atomised digital age. But at more than 370 pages, the tone soon begins to grate, and I started to feel niggles of discomfort at his continually mining working-class voices or cliches for comedy. A slim volume of selected highlights would have sufficed; this includes chapters you suspect were more fun to write than for anyone to read (a 13-page list of gang member names, for example). Jarvis Cocker perhaps puts it best in the introduction: \u201cI respect this book \u2013 but I never want to read it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Endland</em> by Tim Etchells is published by And Other Stories (\u00a311.99).
