      "body": "<p>L<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/last-tango-in-paris\">ast Tango in Paris</a>, Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s controversial piece of 70s art cinema, begins with an oil painting of a man on a red bed wearing just a T-shirt, flashing fleshy legs as his face explodes in inky smears. He\u2019s in a room with a green carpet and yellow walls. For a few moments, Bertolucci shows just this portrait \u2013 of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/freud\">Lucian Freud</a> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bacon\">Francis Bacon</a> \u2013 then a sensual jazz score slowly starts, and the film\u2019s opening credits roll alongside this unmoving canvas. It is succeeded by a brutally dissected female figure sitting on a wooden chair \u2013 another Bacon portrait, this time of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jan/08/guardianobituaries2\">Henrietta Moraes</a>. Eventually, the two paintings are seen side by side. Then we cut to Marlon Brando in a camel overcoat on a Paris bridge, yelling: \u201cFucking God!\u201d</p> <p>Behind Bertolucci\u2019s eerie use of these oil paintings is the shocking story of an art exhibition that gripped Paris, established Bacon as the great European artist he had always dreamt of being \u2013 and left a man dead in a hotel toilet. Bertolucci was so astounded by Bacon\u2019s solo show at the Grand Palais \u2013 which opened in October 1971, just as he was preparing to make his film in the French capital \u2013 that he took Brando to see it. He urged the actor, he later recalled, to \u201ccompare himself with Bacon\u2019s human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon\u2019s face and body were characterised by a strange and infernal plasticity\u201d.</p> <p>This unsettling quality did not limit itself to those two works. The seedily magnificent <a href=\"https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/crgb5kG/rMxekL\">Three Figures in a Room</a>, a triptych of two-metre-tall canvases painted in 1964, has enough infernal plasticity to fill anyone\u2019s nightmares. On the left, a man sits naked on the toilet with his back to us. He seems to have no bones except for a line of vertebrae that poke out through his pink, orange and blue skin, which struggles to contain a spilling spread of relaxed muscle. The man\u2019s buttocks fit like a plug into the white porcelain.</p> <p>The first visitors to the hit retrospective had no idea how uncannily relevant this seven-year-old image was to Bacon\u2019s private anguish. Three Figures in a Room was one of many paintings of the artist\u2019s lover, <a href=\"https://francis-bacon.com/life/family-friends-sitters/george-dyer\">George Dyer</a>, that stole the show. But on 24 October, two days before the exhibition opened, staff at the H\u00f4tel des Saints P\u00e8res found Dyer\u2019s corpse slumped on the toilet. He died from a deliberate overdose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"059ccda76bb5ca294ce7da8995cb0bf91f84e1a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/059ccda76bb5ca294ce7da8995cb0bf91f84e1a7/0_0_2606_3507/743.jpg\" alt=\"Right panel from the triptych In Memory of George Dyer, 1971.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Too nice to be a successful criminal\u2019 \u2026 right panel from the triptych In Memory of George Dyer, 1971.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estate of Francis Bacon/All rights reserved/Adagp, Paris, and DACS, London, 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The peculiar impact Bacon\u2019s art made in Paris, and the violent death that shadowed his success, made this exhibition the defining moment of his art and life. Its spectre is now returning to haunt Paris. This autumn, the Pompidou Centre is mounting <a href=\"https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/agenda/event.action?param.id=FR_R-98422f4ec997b38e22b5fcc316c6dff7&amp;param.idSource=FR_E-98422f4ec997b38e22b5fcc316c6dff7\">a new Bacon blockbuster</a>. It starts by revisiting the Grand Palais show and explores how, from that point until Bacon\u2019s death in 1992, he meditated on Greek tragedy and modern poetry as he repeatedly painted triptychs in memory of Dyer.</p> <p>It was Georges Pompidou, the cultured former president of France whose memorial is the much-loved arts centre, who officially opened the Grand Palais exhibition and was given a tour by Bacon. It\u2019s hard to imagine former British PMs Harold Wilson or Ted Heath taking a similar interest in these outrageous paintings of the tragic human creature. Margaret Thatcher allegedly called Bacon \u201cthat man who paints those dreadful pictures\u201d. But this was France. And Bacon and Paris were made for each other.</p> <p>In this city, with its rich and sleazy avant-garde traditions going back to poets Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud in the 19th century, Bacon was seen in a completely different context from the grey and conservative Britain, where he\u2019d made his name in the 1950s. Like his beloved friend Lucian Freud, he was adept at appealing to British taste with portraits that, however radical, were recognisable and so more acceptable to the sceptical postwar British audience than, say, the abstract American paintings he himself sneered at as \u201cold lace\u201d. But in Paris, the true modernity and extremity of his art needed no humanist veneer. In the city of sex and death, Bacon was completely at home.</p> <p>A photograph of Bacon at the Grand Palais opening offers a glimpse of the French tradition of dirty modernism he so easily slid into. <a href=\"https://www.mbartfoundation.com/en/the-artist/biography/the-grand-palais-retrospective-in-paris/\">It shows him chatting to two white-haired surrealist painters, Andr\u00e9 Masson and Joan Mir\u00f3</a>. Such titans of the prewar Parisian scene were still alive in 1971 \u2013 but Masson connects us with a much earlier outrage. When the wealthy psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan bought Gustave Courbet\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/feb/08/gustave-courbet-origin-world-art\">The Origin of the World</a>, he decided this almost anatomical painting of a woman\u2019s sex organs should have a \u201ccover\u201d, just like erotic paintings in earlier ages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e700e6f293a0caa1bf76d7eff4a657e47ceec52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e700e6f293a0caa1bf76d7eff4a657e47ceec52/0_0_10267_6944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Modernity and extremity \u2026 Francis Bacon in 1985.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modernity and extremity \u2026 Francis Bacon in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Masson painted <a href=\"https://www.lacan.com/courbet.htm\">a ghostly outline of Courbet\u2019s nude</a> on a wooden panel that slid over the then secret masterpiece. It\u2019s an episode that typifies the way sex, preferably of a highly disreputable variety, was cherished as a subversive force by French artists, writers and intellectuals from Courbet to the surrealist movement to its epitaph in Last Tango in Paris. Bacon was intensely aware of this culture, which connected left-bank bookshops with fleapit hotels. His friend and model, the artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/mar/26/isabel-rawsthorne-art-dance-exhibition\">Isabel Rawsthorne</a>, even had an affair with the decadent surrealist writer Georges Bataille, whose 1928 novel Story of the Eye climaxes with the eyeball of a murdered priest being used as a sex toy.</p> <p>In short, Paris was ready for Bacon, and he gave it what it wanted. He included his own equivalent of The Origin of the World among the 100-plus paintings at the Grand Palais: <a href=\"https://www.francis-bacon.com/artworks/paintings/two-figures\">Two Figures</a>, which has the feel of a revelation. A door has opened on a dark bedroom where, on roughly painted white sheets, two naked men have been caught having sex. The man on top leers out of the painting as he and his companion enjoy themselves with animal abandon. It\u2019s one of his greatest paintings, and it could be appreciated in Paris in a way that was still difficult for Britain in 1971.</p> <p>However, it was Bacon\u2019s more recent paintings that defined the show. The star of many of these was a small-time criminal from London\u2019s East End who became Bacon\u2019s lover in 1963. George Dyer came from such a habitually law-breaking family that he remembered his mother trying to rob his pocket money. But he was too \u201cnice\u201d, lamented Bacon, to be a successful criminal. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Realising he couldn\u2019t directly bid for Picasso\u2019s crown unless he painted the female body, Bacon got in training</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The artist could easily afford to keep Dyer out of trouble. Born in Dublin in 1909, Bacon didn\u2019t see artistic success until he painted his wartime nightmare of twisted gargoyles, Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. This was around 1944. By the 60s, with a string of screaming popes behind him, he was rich. Working in a tiny bedsit studio in Kensington, London, he spent his earnings on champagne, fine wines and seafood feasts for his Soho friends. Dyer became part of this slightly desperate bohemia. He went from being a good-looking, well-dressed, would-be gangster to a depressed and clingy alcoholic. As Picasso\u2019s women had found, being a muse sucks.</p> <p>And there was Dyer\u2019s physique smeared all over the Grand Palais in blue, black and livid red. In the triptych <a href=\"https://www.francis-bacon.com/artworks/paintings/three-studies-male-back\">Three Studies of the Male Back</a>, Dyer sits naked in a swivel chair in front of a small, hand-held shaving mirror and a larger rectangular one. Two of the paintings in the triptych show his reflected face as he shaves: it is sharp and hooked, with slicked hair and eyes narrowed and turned away from us. Bacon famously based his popes on Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Portrait of Innocent X \u2013 and this enigmatic face in a mirror echoes another Vel\u00e1zquez painting that was kept just a short stroll from Soho: Rokeby Venus in the National Gallery.</p> <p>Dyer\u2019s back in this triptych is a loose, curvaceous landscape of bone and flesh. It looks as if his skeleton is not joined together but floats independently: a shoulder blade, a spinal column, bulging out of skin that\u2019s soft white and rose, or bruised grey. His neck is massive, his legs roly-poly, his muscles both soft and hard. It is an unabashedly erotic study of male beauty that takes direct inspiration from some of Bacon\u2019s favourite works of art: the drawings of Michelangelo, in which the male back is similarly idolised.</p> <p>Casually erudite references to Vel\u00e1zquez and Michelangelo go naturally with views of people on the toilet in Bacon\u2019s art. He said his was a \u201cgilded gutter life\u201d, veering between luxury and squalor.

      "bodyText": "Last Tango in Paris, Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s controversial piece of 70s art cinema, begins with an oil painting of a man on a red bed wearing just a T-shirt, flashing fleshy legs as his face explodes in inky smears. He\u2019s in a room with a green carpet and yellow walls. For a few moments, Bertolucci shows just this portrait \u2013 of Lucian Freud by Francis Bacon \u2013 then a sensual jazz score slowly starts, and the film\u2019s opening credits roll alongside this unmoving canvas. It is succeeded by a brutally dissected female figure sitting on a wooden chair \u2013 another Bacon portrait, this time of Henrietta Moraes. Eventually, the two paintings are seen side by side. Then we cut to Marlon Brando in a camel overcoat on a Paris bridge, yelling: \u201cFucking God!\u201d Behind Bertolucci\u2019s eerie use of these oil paintings is the shocking story of an art exhibition that gripped Paris, established Bacon as the great European artist he had always dreamt of being \u2013 and left a man dead in a hotel toilet. Bertolucci was so astounded by Bacon\u2019s solo show at the Grand Palais \u2013 which opened in October 1971, just as he was preparing to make his film in the French capital \u2013 that he took Brando to see it. He urged the actor, he later recalled, to \u201ccompare himself with Bacon\u2019s human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon\u2019s face and body were characterised by a strange and infernal plasticity\u201d. This unsettling quality did not limit itself to those two works. The seedily magnificent Three Figures in a Room, a triptych of two-metre-tall canvases painted in 1964, has enough infernal plasticity to fill anyone\u2019s nightmares. On the left, a man sits naked on the toilet with his back to us. He seems to have no bones except for a line of vertebrae that poke out through his pink, orange and blue skin, which struggles to contain a spilling spread of relaxed muscle. The man\u2019s buttocks fit like a plug into the white porcelain. The first visitors to the hit retrospective had no idea how uncannily relevant this seven-year-old image was to Bacon\u2019s private anguish. Three Figures in a Room was one of many paintings of the artist\u2019s lover, George Dyer, that stole the show. But on 24 October, two days before the exhibition opened, staff at the H\u00f4tel des Saints P\u00e8res found Dyer\u2019s corpse slumped on the toilet. He died from a deliberate overdose. The peculiar impact Bacon\u2019s art made in Paris, and the violent death that shadowed his success, made this exhibition the defining moment of his art and life. Its spectre is now returning to haunt Paris. This autumn, the Pompidou Centre is mounting a new Bacon blockbuster. It starts by revisiting the Grand Palais show and explores how, from that point until Bacon\u2019s death in 1992, he meditated on Greek tragedy and modern poetry as he repeatedly painted triptychs in memory of Dyer. It was Georges Pompidou, the cultured former president of France whose memorial is the much-loved arts centre, who officially opened the Grand Palais exhibition and was given a tour by Bacon. It\u2019s hard to imagine former British PMs Harold Wilson or Ted Heath taking a similar interest in these outrageous paintings of the tragic human creature. Margaret Thatcher allegedly called Bacon \u201cthat man who paints those dreadful pictures\u201d. But this was France. And Bacon and Paris were made for each other. In this city, with its rich and sleazy avant-garde traditions going back to poets Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud in the 19th century, Bacon was seen in a completely different context from the grey and conservative Britain, where he\u2019d made his name in the 1950s. Like his beloved friend Lucian Freud, he was adept at appealing to British taste with portraits that, however radical, were recognisable and so more acceptable to the sceptical postwar British audience than, say, the abstract American paintings he himself sneered at as \u201cold lace\u201d. But in Paris, the true modernity and extremity of his art needed no humanist veneer. In the city of sex and death, Bacon was completely at home. A photograph of Bacon at the Grand Palais opening offers a glimpse of the French tradition of dirty modernism he so easily slid into. It shows him chatting to two white-haired surrealist painters, Andr\u00e9 Masson and Joan Mir\u00f3. Such titans of the prewar Parisian scene were still alive in 1971 \u2013 but Masson connects us with a much earlier outrage. When the wealthy psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan bought Gustave Courbet\u2019s The Origin of the World, he decided this almost anatomical painting of a woman\u2019s sex organs should have a \u201ccover\u201d, just like erotic paintings in earlier ages. So Masson painted a ghostly outline of Courbet\u2019s nude on a wooden panel that slid over the then secret masterpiece. It\u2019s an episode that typifies the way sex, preferably of a highly disreputable variety, was cherished as a subversive force by French artists, writers and intellectuals from Courbet to the surrealist movement to its epitaph in Last Tango in Paris. Bacon was intensely aware of this culture, which connected left-bank bookshops with fleapit hotels. His friend and model, the artist Isabel Rawsthorne, even had an affair with the decadent surrealist writer Georges Bataille, whose 1928 novel Story of the Eye climaxes with the eyeball of a murdered priest being used as a sex toy. In short, Paris was ready for Bacon, and he gave it what it wanted. He included his own equivalent of The Origin of the World among the 100-plus paintings at the Grand Palais: Two Figures, which has the feel of a revelation. A door has opened on a dark bedroom where, on roughly painted white sheets, two naked men have been caught having sex. The man on top leers out of the painting as he and his companion enjoy themselves with animal abandon. It\u2019s one of his greatest paintings, and it could be appreciated in Paris in a way that was still difficult for Britain in 1971. However, it was Bacon\u2019s more recent paintings that defined the show. The star of many of these was a small-time criminal from London\u2019s East End who became Bacon\u2019s lover in 1963. George Dyer came from such a habitually law-breaking family that he remembered his mother trying to rob his pocket money. But he was too \u201cnice\u201d, lamented Bacon, to be a successful criminal. The artist could easily afford to keep Dyer out of trouble. Born in Dublin in 1909, Bacon didn\u2019t see artistic success until he painted his wartime nightmare of twisted gargoyles, Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. This was around 1944. By the 60s, with a string of screaming popes behind him, he was rich. Working in a tiny bedsit studio in Kensington, London, he spent his earnings on champagne, fine wines and seafood feasts for his Soho friends. Dyer became part of this slightly desperate bohemia. He went from being a good-looking, well-dressed, would-be gangster to a depressed and clingy alcoholic. As Picasso\u2019s women had found, being a muse sucks. And there was Dyer\u2019s physique smeared all over the Grand Palais in blue, black and livid red. In the triptych Three Studies of the Male Back, Dyer sits naked in a swivel chair in front of a small, hand-held shaving mirror and a larger rectangular one. Two of the paintings in the triptych show his reflected face as he shaves: it is sharp and hooked, with slicked hair and eyes narrowed and turned away from us. Bacon famously based his popes on Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Portrait of Innocent X \u2013 and this enigmatic face in a mirror echoes another Vel\u00e1zquez painting that was kept just a short stroll from Soho: Rokeby Venus in the National Gallery. Dyer\u2019s back in this triptych is a loose, curvaceous landscape of bone and flesh. It looks as if his skeleton is not joined together but floats independently: a shoulder blade, a spinal column, bulging out of skin that\u2019s soft white and rose, or bruised grey. His neck is massive, his legs roly-poly, his muscles both soft and hard. It is an unabashedly erotic study of male beauty that takes direct inspiration from some of Bacon\u2019s favourite works of art: the drawings of Michelangelo, in which the male back is similarly idolised. Casually erudite references to Vel\u00e1zquez and Michelangelo go naturally with views of people on the toilet in Bacon\u2019s art. He said his was a \u201cgilded gutter life\u201d, veering between luxury and squalor. That is also true of his paintings as they mix base details with subtle textures and colours, all in sumptuous canvases that echo the old masters. At the Grand Palais, he was striving for greatness, determined to secure a place in the pantheon of high art. He may have chatted to various famous artists at the opening, but there was only one living painter he really wanted to be compared with: Picasso. Bacon\u2019s critical champion in Paris, who wrote the key essay in the exhibition catalogue, was the surrealist writer Michel Leiris, who was also a close friend of Picasso. According to Leiris, there was a clear connection between the two artists. A 1936 Picasso canvas called Sleeping Nude Woman, which belonged to Leiris and is now in the Pompidou collection, reveals how the men shared a visceral, even obscene surrealism. Picasso distorts female anatomy at will to get a view of his model that\u2019s sheer sensual graffiti. Bacon does the same in his views of Dyer. But he took on Picasso more directly in the years before his Paris show. Realising that he couldn\u2019t bid for the Spaniard\u2019s crown unless he painted the female body, Bacon got in training.

The resulting painting is one of the greatest nudes of the 20th century \u2013 and a bizarrely empowering one. Moraes lies with her feet towards us on a bed, her hips majestic, her right arm slung back, her animal-mask face unmistakably echoing Picasso\u2019s Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon. Bacon was bidding to be recognised for what he was: the most visionary painter of human beings since Picasso. He was not going to let a private tragedy spoil that.

Some newspapers are just as incapable of abiding by principles of human decency and basic journalistic ethics as they were during the phone-hacking scandal.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Sun said: \u201cThe Sun has the utmost sympathy for Ben Stokes and his mother but it is only right to point out the story was told with the cooperation of a family member who supplied details, provided photographs and posed for pictures. The tragedy is also a matter of public record and was the subject of extensive front-page publicity in New Zealand at the time. \u201cThe Sun has huge admiration for Ben Stokes and we were delighted to celebrate his sporting heroics this summer. He was contacted prior to publication and at no stage did he or his representatives ask us not to publish the story.\u201d Stokes is the runaway favourite to be named BBC Sports Personality of the Year in December, having helped England win the World Cup in July before playing a starring role in the drawn Ashes series. His unbeaten 135 to turn what looked like certain defeat into a memorable one-wicket third Ashes test win over Australia at Headingley was hailed as one of the greatest batting displays of all time. Twelve months ago, Stokes was cleared of affray at a court in Bristol after a high-profile trial that followed a late-night brawl.",
