I\u2019ve asked Facebook repeatedly whether it plans to have a different policy on speech by politicians or political advertisements in non-democratic countries over the past two weeks, to no avail. This isn\u2019t just a gotcha question. It is a matter of urgent importance, and one that speaks to what, to me, is a much more telling aspect of Harbath\u2019s professional history: her actual work for Facebook. A blockbuster December 2017 article in Bloomberg detailed Harbath\u2019s extraordinary track record leading \u201ca little-known Facebook global government and politics team that\u2019s neutral in that it works with nearly anyone seeking or securing power\u201d. According to the report, Harbath\u2019s staff became \u201cde facto campaign workers\u201d for political campaigns in some of the world\u2019s biggest democracies; they assisted Narendra Modi in India, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany, and Andrzej Duda in Poland. Two years after the article\u2019s publication, it\u2019s impossible not to notice that democracy has been severely degraded under the regimes that the Facebook team helped achieve power. What do Zuckerberg\u2019s bromides about democracy mean to Facebook users in Kashmir, where Modi has blocked the internet for 13 weeks and on Thursday dissolved the constitution? What do his paeans to the free press mean to Facebook users in the Philippines, where Duterte has used his office to attempt to silence an independent journalist working to expose extrajudicial killings and human rights violations? Will Facebook update its \u201cSuccess Story\u201d about playing a \u201ccentral role\u201d in the way Duda is \u201cinnovating communication between the government and the public\u201d as fears grow that democracy in Poland is eroding under his party\u2019s rule? The paradox here is that Facebook is more accountable to US lawmakers and reporters than it is to any other country\u2019s. It is incumbent on American politicians and the American press to keep this in mind \u2013 and push Facebook to answer questions about how its policies will apply to the vast majority of its users. What I\u2019m reading \u201cWhy is the principal of our school on a first-name basis with the CEO of a company who is collecting data about our kids?\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Heather Kelly reports on the proliferation of classroom management apps in elementary and high schools. Microsoft has pledged not to use facial recognition in ways that infringe on democratic freedoms. So why did it fund a startup that is being used to surveil Palestinians in the West Bank, according to this investigation by NBC News\u2019s Olivia Solon? \u201cYou can replace your credit card number, but you can\u2019t replace your genome.\u201d Antonio Regaldo explains how the DNA database that was used to find the Golden State Killer could be a national security threat.
