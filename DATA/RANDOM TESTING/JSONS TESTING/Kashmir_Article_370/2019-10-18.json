      "bodyText": "Intense fighting has erupted in the Mexican city of Culiac\u00e1n, where masked gunmen threw up burning barricades and traded gunfire with security forces after authorities arrested one of the sons of the jailed former leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. Mexico\u2019s security minister, Alfonso Durazo, said a patrol by National Guard militarised police first came under attack from within a house in the city, 600 km (370 miles) northwest of Mexico City. After entering the house, they arrested Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, who is accused of drug trafficking in the United States. However, the patrol was quickly overpowered by cartel gunmen, and the decision was taken to withdraw to protect the lives of the National Guard and restore calm in the city, where gangsters had set up roadblocks and were unleashing heavy automatic gunfire, Durazo said. Images shared on social media showed trucks with mounted heavy machine guns patrolling the city streets. Another clip showed a gunman with an assault rifle shooting at an unknown target against a soundtrack of continuous gunfire. Local media had reported that at least one of the main roads out of the city towards the port of Mazatl\u00e1n had been blocked by a barricade of burning trucks, while others were closed by the army. Photographs were circulating on social media purporting to show Ovidio in detention in a light blue shirt, with what appeared to be religious medallions around his neck. \u201cThe decision was taken to retreat from the house, without Guzman to try to avoid more violence in the area and preserve the lives of our personnel and recover calm in the city,\u201d Durazo said. Thursday\u2019s shootouts initially prompted rumours that they were triggered by the arrest of Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzman Salazar, another of Chapo\u2019s sons. It\u2019s unclear if he was detained. The 28-year-old Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez is one of four children from Chapo\u2019s second marriage. He is named together with his elder brother, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, in an indictment related to cocaine trafficking released by the US Department of Justice in February this year. Chapo Guzm\u00e1n had two other wives and at least six more children. The murder of 22-year-old Edgar Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez in a Culiacan parking lot May 2008 sparked a major turf war between Chapo and his former allies from the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva cartel that raged for years. The Sinaloa public security secretary, Crist\u00f3bal Casta\u00f1eda, told Milenio TV that as well as roving shootouts and barricades, the chaos included a mass jailbreak of between 20 and 30 inmates. \u201cWe are inviting people to get off the streets until we have re-established control of the city,\u201d he said. Guzm\u00e1n, whose cartel was once billed as the most powerful drug trafficking organization in the world, was sentenced to life in prison by a US federal court in January. Over the course of decades in the business, the 62-year-old had been arrested three times \u2013 twice in Mexico and once in Guatemala \u2013 and managed to make two spectacular escapes from high-security Mexican jails. Chapo\u2019s second arrest in 2014 took place in the port city of Mazatl\u00e1n without a shot being fired. He was in the company of his third wife and their two baby daughters at the time. Two of the drug lord\u2019s eldest sons, Iv\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar, have appeared to lead the family\u2019s bid to retain control of the cartel after his final downfall began with his third arrest in January 2016. Both sons were reportedly kidnapped in August of that year from a swanky restaurant in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta by the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s then up and coming rival the New Generation Jalisco Cartel. Officials only ever confirmed the abduction and release a week later of Jes\u00fas Alfredo.",
