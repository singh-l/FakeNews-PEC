China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty extensive and one of my concerns would be \u2013 in part because this is happening in a democratic state \u2013 it could be seen as a new departure for many states that are thinking about how to clamp down on the flow of information.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added that it was hard to identify a set of circumstances where a country shutting down access to the internet, especially for an extensive period of time, was legal under international law.</p> \n<p>Before the announcement on Monday, thousands of extra <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/kashmir-leaders-placed-under-arrest-amid-security-crackdown\">troops were deployed</a> to Kashmir, where the government is likely to face major opposition. An insurgency against Indian rule has been waged for decades, and tens of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict. Despite a heavy security presence and strict curfew, protests have occurred.</p> \n<p>The restrictions have prevented people from calling for ambulances, accessing information or checking on family members. On Thursday, an opposition activist filed a petition in India\u2019s highest court challenging the security lockdown and communications block.</p> \n<p>In his first address to the nation since parliament was told article 370 \u2013 the part of the constitution guaranteeing Jammu and Kashmir special status \u2013 had been revoked, Modi described the changes as historic and attempted to assure residents the situation would soon become normal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ca8838fb-ebec-498c-a2c2-1dd688573ef2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Governments around the world have used internet blackouts, or blocked popular platforms such as WhatsApp, at times of political crisis.

      "bodyText": "The unprecedented communications blackout imposed on Indian-administered Kashmir could signal a departure in the way in which democratic states clamp down on information in contentious areas, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, has said. India\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, made his first public statement on Thursday since the decision to remove Kashmir\u2019s special status, describing it as the start of a \u201cnew era\u201d that will help end decades of terrorism and separatism. Kaye told the Guardian: \u201cThere\u2019s something about this shutdown that is draconian in a way other shutdowns usually are not.\u201d The territory faces its fifth day in a lockdown imposed hours before the Indian government revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status, stripping away the autonomy it was granted in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947. Communications are often blocked in Indian-administered Kashmir, but the current clampdown is unprecedented in a time of relative peace. Unlike previous instances, landline phones and cable TV have been cut off. A strict curfew also means people are unable to leave their homes during the day, while only limited movement has been allowed at night. \u201cI can\u2019t recall a situation where there has been a total blackout of not only the two-way, multi-point communication systems that we are familiar with now \u2013 anything on the internet, WhatsApp etc \u2013 but also the one-direction communications like TV,\u201d Kaye said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty extensive and one of my concerns would be \u2013 in part because this is happening in a democratic state \u2013 it could be seen as a new departure for many states that are thinking about how to clamp down on the flow of information.\u201d He added that it was hard to identify a set of circumstances where a country shutting down access to the internet, especially for an extensive period of time, was legal under international law. Before the announcement on Monday, thousands of extra troops were deployed to Kashmir, where the government is likely to face major opposition. An insurgency against Indian rule has been waged for decades, and tens of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict. Despite a heavy security presence and strict curfew, protests have occurred. The restrictions have prevented people from calling for ambulances, accessing information or checking on family members. On Thursday, an opposition activist filed a petition in India\u2019s highest court challenging the security lockdown and communications block. In his first address to the nation since parliament was told article 370 \u2013 the part of the constitution guaranteeing Jammu and Kashmir special status \u2013 had been revoked, Modi described the changes as historic and attempted to assure residents the situation would soon become normal. \u201cThe scrapping of article 370 is the beginning of a new era,\u201d Modi said. Kashmir\u2019s special status had been used by Pakistan \u201cas a weapon to incite people of the region against India\u201d, but now India would rid the region of \u201cterrorism and terrorists\u201d, he added. \u201cThere will be a lot of development,\u201d Modi said. \u201cAll the citizens will be given their rights.\u201d Modi said the \u201cmainstreaming\u201d of the Kashmiri people with the rest of the nation would expedite development and create new jobs with investment from public and private companies, and even suggested a cinema industry could flourish. \u201cI think the whole world will come and shoot their films there,\u201d he said. \u201c[This will] bring employment for the people there.\u201d In other developments on Thursday, the state-run All India Radio reported more than 500 people had been arrested since the clampdown began, and Pakistan had suspended a key rail service with India and banned the screening of Indian films. A Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman also said authorities were considering approaching the international court of justice for a case against India. The two countries have fought two of their three wars over control of Kashmir. Indian-administered Kashmir has had a special status since 1954, giving it a degree of autonomy including its own constitution, as well as rules that prevented people from outside the state from buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believe this is crucial to protecting the demography and traditions of India\u2019s only Muslim-majority state. Delhi has insisted the ending of autonomy for the region is an internal matter. On Wednesday, one man arriving at Delhi\u2019s airport from Srinagar, Kashmir\u2019s biggest city, described the state as being \u201clike a prison\u201d. Soayib Qureshi, a Delhi-based lawyer who arrived on the same day, said he had been given a handwritten boarding pass for the flight because systems were down.
