      "body": "<p>On Monday 16 August 1819, 60,000 people from across Manchester and the surrounding areas attended a peaceful rally at St Peter\u2019s Field to demand political representation and hear <a href=\"https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/hunt-henry-1773-1835\">\u2018Orator\u2019 Henry Hunt</a> speak. Local magistrates had arranged for large support from armed cavalry officers and untrained volunteer yeomanry regiments. They were ordered to charge the crowd and arrest Hunt before he could start his speech. At least 15 people were killed and over 600 were injured. The event soon became known as Peterloo \u2013 a reference to the 1815 Battle of Waterloo.</p> <p>In the crowd was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/john-edward-taylor-peterloo-teaching-resource-gnm-archive\">John Edward Taylor</a>, a cotton merchant and journalist. The 28 year old had a keen interest in social and political reform and wrote for a number of liberal local newspapers including Manchester Gazette. John Tyas, a reporter from the Times in London sent to cover the event, was arrested.

      "bodyText": "On Monday 16 August 1819, 60,000 people from across Manchester and the surrounding areas attended a peaceful rally at St Peter\u2019s Field to demand political representation and hear \u2018Orator\u2019 Henry Hunt speak. Local magistrates had arranged for large support from armed cavalry officers and untrained volunteer yeomanry regiments. They were ordered to charge the crowd and arrest Hunt before he could start his speech. At least 15 people were killed and over 600 were injured. The event soon became known as Peterloo \u2013 a reference to the 1815 Battle of Waterloo. In the crowd was John Edward Taylor, a cotton merchant and journalist. The 28 year old had a keen interest in social and political reform and wrote for a number of liberal local newspapers including Manchester Gazette. John Tyas, a reporter from the Times in London sent to cover the event, was arrested. This prompted Taylor to send his eyewitness account to be published in London with the aim of holding the authorities to account before they tried to disseminate a different version of the event. Taylor served the committee that helped the victims of Peterloo, reported on the injured and produced the pamphlet Notes and Observations responding to a Government report which defended the magistrates. A few months before Peterloo, a friend had encouraged Taylor to set up a liberal newspaper and the events of 16 August 1819 strengthened his resolve to do so. By April 1821 he had been lent funds from 11 friends and fellow reformers. The paper\u2019s prospectus reflected its commitment to social and political reform demanded by those who came to the rally at St Peter\u2019s Field. An extract from it states The Manchester Guardian \u201cwill zealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty, in the most comprehensive sense of those terms; it will warmly advocate the cause of Reform; it will endeavour to assist in the diffusion of just principles of Political Economy; and support \u2026 whatever measures may ... promote the moral advantage, or the political welfare, of the Community\u201d. The first edition of the paper was published on Saturday 5 May 1821. 200 years after Peterloo, the event is being widely remembered with whole series of events, exhibitions and a permanent memorial.

Microplastics significantly contaminating air, say scientists Microplastics are contaminating not just the oceans, but the air, according to a study that found high levels of microplastic pollution in snow from the Arctic to the Alps.

The poets also haunt Salman Rushdie\u2019s Kashmir novel, Shalimar the Clown, and appear in Kashmir: The Case for Freedom, by writers including Arundhati Roy. Her essential novel The Ministry of Utmost Happiness tracks the rise of Hindu nationalism over decades and brings us almost up to date in Kashmir. As for Indian culpability, two novels stand out. The Far Field by Madhuri Vijay and Jaspreet Singh\u2019s elegiac Chef bear witness to decades of denial and silencing. With the 72nd anniversary of partition falling this week, these works entreat us to hear what the people of Kashmir have to say. \u2022 We That Are Young by Preti Taneja is published by Galley Beggar.

Jo Swinson, the leader of the Lib Dems, called the idea \u201ca nonsense\u201d, arguing Corbyn would not be able to secure the cross-party backing needed. Others were more amenable, with the SNP and Plaid Cymru welcoming Corbyn\u2019s call for talks \u2013 although Plaid stood with the Greens in arguing a referendum should come before any election.</p> \n<p>Some Labour MPs have said meanwhile that they would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/labour-bloc-plans-radical-move-to-push-through-brexit-deal\">consider backing Theresa May\u2019s deal or a version of it after all</a>. \u201cI think Boris will present a deal to parliament, roll something in glitter and get themselves over the line and a number of my colleagues would vote for that deal at that point,\u201d one MP said. \u201cA second referendum is so divisive and no deal is so damaging.\u201d On the more batty side, the Conservative backbencher Tom Tugendhat is arguing the UK could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/uk-could-unilaterally-exit-eu-in-next-10-days-senior-tory-mp-says\">make a snap Brexit on 24 August</a>, followed by an immediate general election, with the Irish border issue solved by a Northern Ireland-only backstop. No 10 says it has no such plan.</p> \n<p>Farmers for a People\u2019s Vote will herd a small flock of sheep past the Cabinet Office this morning as they warn that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/15/half-of-uk-farms-could-fail-after-no-deal-brexit-report-warns\">more than half of UK farms could go broke</a> if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October. The group says the EU and other countries would immediately apply tariffs and other barriers on food imports from the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit. At the same time, UK tariffs on imports would be slashed in order to keep prices down for consumers, with British farmers left unable to compete.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018We will give a solid response\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Tensions have heightened over Kashmir after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/kashmir-more-protests-expected-as-india-marks-independence\">Pakistan\u2019s PM, Imran Khan, threatened to \u201cteach India a lesson\u201d</a> over its revocation of the disputed region\u2019s special status. \u201cThe Pakistani army has solid information that they [India] are planning to do something in Pakistani Kashmir, and they are ready and will give a solid response,\u201d said Khan. Millions of people in Indian-administered Kashmir remain without landlines, mobiles or internet access. A short while ago this morning the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, gave an independence day speech hailing the abolition of Kashmir\u2019s special status as a major national achievement.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Everest rules tightened \u2013 </strong>All climbers seeking a permit for Everest will need prior <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/14/nepal-sets-new-rules-for-everest-climbers-after-deadly-season\">high-altitude mountaineering experience and demonstrable training</a>, an expert commission for the Nepalese government has ruled. Eleven climbers were killed or went missing on the mountain in May: nine on the Nepalese side and two on the Tibetan side. Climbers and guides criticised officials for allowing anyone who paid \u00a39,000 to attempt the ascent. Nepal issued 381 permits for Everest for this year\u2019s climbing season. Ghanshyam Upadhyaya, a senior tourism ministry official, said: \u201cThe government will now make the required changes in laws and regulations guiding mountain climbing.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Lib Dems sign up ex-Tory \u2013 </strong>Sarah Wollaston, the Totnes former Conservative MP, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/14/totnes-mp-sarah-wollaston-joins-the-liberal-democrats\">joined the Liberal Democrats</a>.

Researchers say \u201cdeep racial and ethnic inequalities\u201d are not being adequately addressed by economic plans such as the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d.
