When we talk about no deal being the table, what we really mean is that it is the present default position. It is absolutely true that, unless we agree a deal, we will leave the EU without one \u2013 be that on the 29th of this month, if no extension is granted; or, if an extension is granted, when that extension expires. No deal is, as things stand, the ultimate default position. But what is untrue is the assertion that no deal can\u2019t be taken off the table.

The decision of the European court of justice in the Wightman case gave the United Kingdom an absolute right to revoke the article 50 notice and remain in the European Union.

We cannot sensibly ignore the fact that MPs have now twice rejected the form of Brexit negotiated by the prime minister: they have also rejected Labour\u2019s proposed softer Brexit, and tonight they rejected a third form of Brexit \u2013 no deal. The best way now to take this process forward \u2013 the way to achieve the consensus that citizens and business desperately needs \u2013 is to create the powerful incentive for cross-party working among pro-Brexit MPs of no Brexit. Nor does revocation rule out a later renotification.

But the lobbying underlines the precariousness of the British position.</p> <p>Leave.EU touted its connections with Eurosceptic forces in Europe on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaveEUOfficial/status/1105795719720505345\">tweeting</a>: \u201cThe British establishment would do well to remember the Eurosceptic scene is a close-knit group across the continent and on the rise \u2013 some are now in power! If our politicians betray Brexit and vote for delay, Matteo Salvini can defend the 17.4 million and veto!\u201d Salvini is Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister and a Eurosceptic.</p> <p>It is claimed Leave.EU\u2019s Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore visited Veneto last week to discuss with senior figures in Salvini\u2019s party, the League, what attitude the Italian government might take towards article 50.</p> <p>Banks said the claim was \u201ccodswallop\u201d and a conspiracy peddled by the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr.</p> <p>Speaking in the European parliament, the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage told MEPs: \u201cThe solution to avoid hordes of new Brexit party MEPs being elected is for the European council to veto any extension of article 50 and ensure we leave on 29 March.\u201d</p> <p>Three Conservative MPs flew to Warsaw last Thursday to meet members of the Polish governing party to discuss the Brexit crisis. They met Anna Maria Anders, the Polish minister for international dialogue in the prime minister\u2019s office and a senator. The British MPs included two former cabinet ministers, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson.</p> <p>Anders told the Guardian: \u201cI am definitely against deferment and another referendum. We have had two years to get this together. I do not see an extension is going to make any difference. We want to see some agreement because a delay is a case for concern.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the extensive British internal debate, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to have these discussions, but I get the feeling they are going nowhere. Sometimes you just have to make a decision, and if someone disagrees, that is the price. You cannot please everyone.</p> <p>\u201cI am also against a second referendum.

      "bodyText": "Leading Eurosceptics are lobbying right-of-centre governments in Europe to see if they would veto a British extension of article 50 and so ensure the UK drops out of the EU at the end of the month without a deal. In theory, only one country is required to wield its veto for any British request to be rejected. It is highly unlikely this lobbying will succeed as the governments in countries such as Hungary, Italy and Poland have other more important battles to fight with the EU. But the lobbying underlines the precariousness of the British position. Leave.EU touted its connections with Eurosceptic forces in Europe on Wednesday, tweeting: \u201cThe British establishment would do well to remember the Eurosceptic scene is a close-knit group across the continent and on the rise \u2013 some are now in power! If our politicians betray Brexit and vote for delay, Matteo Salvini can defend the 17.4 million and veto!\u201d Salvini is Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister and a Eurosceptic. It is claimed Leave.EU\u2019s Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore visited Veneto last week to discuss with senior figures in Salvini\u2019s party, the League, what attitude the Italian government might take towards article 50. Banks said the claim was \u201ccodswallop\u201d and a conspiracy peddled by the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr. Speaking in the European parliament, the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage told MEPs: \u201cThe solution to avoid hordes of new Brexit party MEPs being elected is for the European council to veto any extension of article 50 and ensure we leave on 29 March.\u201d Three Conservative MPs flew to Warsaw last Thursday to meet members of the Polish governing party to discuss the Brexit crisis. They met Anna Maria Anders, the Polish minister for international dialogue in the prime minister\u2019s office and a senator. The British MPs included two former cabinet ministers, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. Anders told the Guardian: \u201cI am definitely against deferment and another referendum. We have had two years to get this together. I do not see an extension is going to make any difference. We want to see some agreement because a delay is a case for concern.\u201d Referring to the extensive British internal debate, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to have these discussions, but I get the feeling they are going nowhere. Sometimes you just have to make a decision, and if someone disagrees, that is the price. You cannot please everyone. \u201cI am also against a second referendum. If there is a small majority to remain, there is no progress, and if there is a majority to leave, what was the point?\u201d The overall view of the Polish government \u2013 traditionally seen as one of the UK\u2019s closest allies in Europe \u2013 is likely to be to support an extension, especially if there is pressure on France and Germany to make such a move. Poland has many quarrels with the EU, some dramatised for domestic consumption, and would not wish to be seen as the cause of a no-deal Brexit that would damage the entire European economy. But some in Europe do not share Farage\u2019s view that a prolonged Brexit impasse will benefit the populist right in the European parliament elections this spring. In his personal manifesto for the European elections last week, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, repeatedly used the British travails over Brexit as a stick with which to beat what he described as the European right\u2019s unobtainable promises and lies. Anders revealed that the Polish government was still in talks with Salvini and the League about the possibility of forming a political alliance after the European elections. Anders met Salvini a fortnight ago, and she said he told her that his reported links with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, were exaggerated. She said her own party was strongly pro-Nato and critical of Russia. She also said she would not take seriously the ideas of anyone who like Macron had only about 20% support in their own country.",

Winds reached 60 miles per hour for a second day across coasts as Storm Gareth continued to move across the UK on Wednesday. The fishermen were airlifted from a 79ft French fishing boat off Land\u2019s End after it suffered engine failure. Another fishing vessel went to help and a lifeboat was launched after the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it was alerted at approximately 10pm on Tuesday night. \u201cDespite atrocious weather, Sennen Cove lifeboat launched but due to 5-6 metre [16-20ft] waves on scene and storm-force winds, it was impossible for either the fishing vessel or the lifeboat to establish a tow with La Fanette,\u201d the MCA said. Two yellow warnings have been issued by the Met Office for high winds covering Northern Ireland, Wales, most of England and the west coast of Scotland. Commuters were warned on Wednesday morning that transport links could be affected as the squally weather blows through \u2013 while racing at the Cheltenham festival was briefly in doubt before authorities gave the green light. People using trains in Wales, Scotland, the north of England and East Anglia were warned that services could be disrupted by high winds with speed restrictions in place across a wide area. Trains between Durham and Newcastle were halted on Wednesday morning after overhead electric wires were damaged, while some Virgin Trains services between Manchester and London and some trains between Glasgow Central and Preston were cancelled. There were also reports of trees blocking roads and some exposed routes in the north-east of England being closed to high-sided vehicles. Meanwhile, the residents of Llandudno in north Wales had unexpected visitors as a result of the storm when a 122-strong herd of Kashmir goats were seen wandering into the town centre by local residents, having been driven from their home of Great Orme Park by the bad weather. The animals were spotted eating flowers in people\u2019s gardens, as well as walking out in front of traffic.

There is no way of stopping them. It is more likely in foul weather as they look for lower ground and shelter.\u201d The goats originally came to Llandudno as a gift to Lord Mostyn from Queen Victoria in the late 19th century and have since been housed on the hillsides of the Great Orme summit. Winds were forecast to fade later on Wednesday while Thursday was forecast to be less windy but with further showers, some wintry. Another weather front of rain and winds was forecast to sweep across Britain on Friday. Day two of the Cheltenham festival was expected to proceed as planned after the track passed a precautionary inspection. Officials had planned an 8am check and announced a contingency to postpone Wednesday\u2019s card until Saturday, as a forecast for high winds threatened the card. Course officials were able to give the go-ahead at about 6.10am as conditions were not expected to be as bad as first feared. Met \u00c9ireann, the Irish meteorological service, also warned of \u201csevere and damaging gusts\u201d as the storm moved over the country.",

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel has said that securing EU leaders\u2019 agreement on a Brexit delay up until the end of June will be \u201ceasy\u201d, according to senior diplomatic sources. Attitudes in some of the EU\u2019s capitals towards a possible extension of article 50 have recently hardened, with diplomats complaining that London had been \u201clazy\u201d and taken a positive decision for granted. But the German chancellor let it be known at the recent EU-Arab summit in Sharm el-Sheikh that Berlin will not stand in the way, sources have disclosed to the Guardian. Theresa May told the Commons on Tuesday night after losing by 149 votes, the fourth largest defeat ever on a government motion, that if MPs voted to reject a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday, she would bring forward a motion on Thursday asking whether MPs want to seek an extension to article 50. She suggested such an extension would be short, but warned this risked a new cliff-edge in June, signalling the British government is looking at a three-month delay. The EU\u2019s heads of state and government will discuss their terms and conditions for an extension at an upcoming summit should the Commons call on the prime minister to make a request. During talks in the Egyptian Red Sea resort last month, Merkel is understood to have insisted that an extension until the European elections on the 23 May would be \u201cvery easy\u201d. A longer delay until 30 June, before the parliament convenes would be \u201ceasy\u201d, she added. A spokesman for the German government declined to comment. Despite the confidence in Berlin at winning over the 27 heads of state and government, who would need to offer their unanimous support once a request is made, officials in Brussels fear Downing Street\u2019s proposal for a delay could still tee up a potential disaster next week with a high risk that the leaders could react in unexpected ways. The heads of state and government have repeatedly taken a tougher line than expected towards the British government. The outright rejection of May\u2019s Chequers proposals at a summit last year in Salzburg was the most notable embarrassment for Downing Street. Officials said that, rather than try to guide leaders\u2019 decision at the summit, Brussels was currently preparing for them to have a free-wheeling debate. \u201cThe messier things are, the greater the chance things are escalated up to the leaders,\u201d one EU source said. EU officials said there was growing \u201cfrustration\u201d at the prime minister\u2019s reluctance to even prepare the way for an extension request. In a letter the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker to Donald Tusk, his counterpart in the European council, said the UK\u2019s withdrawal should be complete before the European elections on 23 May as British MEPs would otherwise need to be elected. Officials representing Tusk informed ambassadors on Monday, however, that they believed an extension until July was still feasible as the European parliament would not have convened until that point. Sources suggested that the European commission, as \u201cguardian of the EU\u2019s treaties\u201d, was simply preparing the ground for a formal infringement notice on the UK should the government not organise elections, but that 23 May was not the outer limit of an extension. A greater concern in Brussels is that the EU\u2019s leaders might rule out any extension unless there is a clear reason beyond simply delaying an inevitable no-deal Brexit. EU sources said that pressure from business is still likely to push leaders towards granting an extension of a few months, but there was a particular concern in the EU\u2019s capitals that by simply waiving it through Brussels could end up being blamed for a no-deal Brexit in the summer. Senior EU officials have warned member states that a very short extension would be \u201cuseless\u201d and \u201cresolve nothing\u201d, and be a burden on businesses rather than a help. \u201cThe internal EU debate on extending Article 50 is definitely getting more complicated,\u201d, said Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing sense that a short term extension won\u2019t fix anything, and member states are becoming more anxious about being complicit in agreeing to something that simply makes no- deal more likely in June.\u201d",
