But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This has been no secret, but rather a longterm and explicit goal of the BJP.

      "bodyText": "The significance of Kashmir to India is difficult to exaggerate. The decision by Narendra Modi\u2019s recently re-elected government to remove the disputed Himalayan region\u2019s special status under the constitution is no legal technicality, but a statement of intent and ideology. As the predominantly Hindu India\u2019s only Muslim majority state, adherents of the country\u2019s secular tradition of politics have long seen Kashmir\u2019s continuing inclusion within the vast democracy as evidence that all faiths can thrive together. This contrasts India\u2019s immense religious diversity with neighbouring Pakistan\u2019s strong Muslim identity. But for Hindu nationalists such as Modi and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), the privileges granted by article 370 of the constitution to Kashmir were concessions that a strong India united under their saffron banner no longer needed to make. This has been no secret, but rather a longterm and explicit goal of the BJP. It was a campaign promise in recent elections, where Modi dealt the opposition Congress party, the historical standard bearers of the \u201csecularist\u201d vision of India, a further crushing defeat. The provisions for Kashmir have their origin in the deal made when the former princedom opted to join India in the immediate aftermath of its independence from Britain in 1947.

The issue of Kashmir is fiercely emotive in neighbouring Pakistan, which has fought three full-scale wars with India, two over the disputed province.

It features Madhu, a woman whose head has been stolen by her obsessive lover. She is awaiting the arrival of \u201can idiot of a photographer\u201d who wants to capture her and \u201call the wonderful and vicious things that happened along the Indian coastline\u201d.</p> <p>The images that follow are indeed wonderful and vicious, almost hallucinatory in their intensity: lovers embrace, angry men come to blows, revellers are caught in closeup, eyes bloodshot, faces daubed with powdered paint, lips smeared with lipstick. Moments of violence are caught in the flashbulb\u2019s glare: a machete drips blood on a bare foot, a man holds a brick above another man he has pinned to the pavement, a woman stares in terror at something \u2013 or someone \u2013 just out of the frame.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was tapping into the discomfort I was feeling wandering the streets at night, but also as someone immersed in the language of social media.

In its raw immediacy, the book reflects what he describes as \u201cthe non-aesthetic of so many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/14/future-photography-in-the-age-of-instagram-essay-sean-o-hagan\">images uploaded on social media</a>, which has now become an aesthetic in itself\u201d. The result is one of the most powerfully unsettling photobooks of the year.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the images in the book are real,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut I have messed around with them afterwards. I have also witnessed and tried to defuse real fights. So, some of it is theatre, some of it real-life drama. I\u2019m playing with ideas of voyeurism and trust, manipulating the viewer.

We are all complicit in that blurring of boundaries, even if we are just looking.\u201d</p> <p>In its iconoclastic way, Hura\u2019s book also reflects the volatility of contemporary Indian society, the uneasy dynamic between the new entrepreneurial class who are driving the country\u2019s rapidly growing economy, and a more traditional culture in which rigid ideas of faith, caste and political allegiance still hold sway and are increasingly given violent expression. Of late, he says, he has been attuned to \u201can increasing dissonance\u201d in Indian politics and public debate.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a kind of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFRuKs7ZfEk\">new, aggressive nationalism</a> that expresses itself in rioting, often engineered rioting,\u201d he says. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/05/malevolent-republic-short-history-of-new-india-ks-komireddi-review\">As soon as Narendra Modi [India\u2019s current prime minister] took power</a>, something shifted. There is a TV channel just for Modi and his message, there are comic books about him. The government is building a new narrative that is a kind of Indian populism. Everywhere there is doubt <em>and</em> a need to believe.

      "bodyText": "Sohrab Hura\u2019s photobook, The Coast, begins with a fantastical short story written by him. It features Madhu, a woman whose head has been stolen by her obsessive lover. She is awaiting the arrival of \u201can idiot of a photographer\u201d who wants to capture her and \u201call the wonderful and vicious things that happened along the Indian coastline\u201d. The images that follow are indeed wonderful and vicious, almost hallucinatory in their intensity: lovers embrace, angry men come to blows, revellers are caught in closeup, eyes bloodshot, faces daubed with powdered paint, lips smeared with lipstick. Moments of violence are caught in the flashbulb\u2019s glare: a machete drips blood on a bare foot, a man holds a brick above another man he has pinned to the pavement, a woman stares in terror at something \u2013 or someone \u2013 just out of the frame. Throughout, Hura merges the real and the fictional, the found and the constructed, his harsh, unforgiving flash illuminating what he calls \u201cthe loneliness and suspicion of the Indian night\u201d. In its raw immediacy, the book reflects what he describes as \u201cthe non-aesthetic of so many of the images uploaded on social media, which has now become an aesthetic in itself\u201d. The result is one of the most powerfully unsettling photobooks of the year. \u201cMany of the images in the book are real,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut I have messed around with them afterwards. I have also witnessed and tried to defuse real fights. So, some of it is theatre, some of it real-life drama. I\u2019m playing with ideas of voyeurism and trust, manipulating the viewer. Nothing is definite, everything is raw and overwhelming. This is the image world we now live in.\u201d The idiot photographer mocked by his character, Madhu \u2013 \u201cWhy on Earth would anybody waste time on something like this?\u201d \u2013 is, of course Hura himself, but also, he tells me, the voyeuristic viewer. \u201cIn a way, I was tapping into the discomfort I was feeling both as a photographer wandering the streets at night, but also as someone immersed in the image language of social media \u2013 what is right, what is wrong, what is true, what is fake? We are all complicit in that blurring of boundaries, even if we are just looking.\u201d In its iconoclastic way, Hura\u2019s book also reflects the volatility of contemporary Indian society, the uneasy dynamic between the new entrepreneurial class who are driving the country\u2019s rapidly growing economy, and a more traditional culture in which rigid ideas of faith, caste and political allegiance still hold sway and are increasingly given violent expression. Of late, he says, he has been attuned to \u201can increasing dissonance\u201d in Indian politics and public debate. \u201cThere is a kind of new, aggressive nationalism that expresses itself in rioting, often engineered rioting,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as Narendra Modi [India\u2019s current prime minister] took power, something shifted. There is a TV channel just for Modi and his message, there are comic books about him. The government is building a new narrative that is a kind of Indian populism. Everywhere there is doubt and a need to believe. I think it is reaching a kind of critical point now.\u201d Since we spoke, that ethnic tension has escalated considerably with Modi\u2019s Hindu-led nationalist government controversially revoking Kashmir\u2019s special status, instigating a widespread security clampdown involving thousands of troops. A security order has been issued banning public meetings, rallies and movement, while access to the internet, the main means for activists to organise protests, has been cut off across the disputed Himalayan region where seven million people live. While Modi\u2019s hardline supporters see the move as the righting of a historical wrong, Masood Khan, president of the Pakistan-controlled portion of Kashmir, has said it could lead to a war with Pakistan. Hura belongs to an emerging generation of young Indian photographers questioning the role of the image-maker in this shifting political and social culture. Given the times, has he received flak from critics for misrepresenting, or sensationalising, aspects of Indian life, its religious and cultural traditions? \u201cNot really. Some people are shocked by the images, some taken aback in a good way.

I think most people get that.\u201d Hura was born in a small town in West Bengal and now lives in New Delhi.

He is self-taught having learned the basics, when he accompanied \u201c a proper photographer to shoot mountains and sunrises. They were nothing special, but it was the first time in a long time I felt good about myself.\u201d Two of his earlier series, Life Is Elsewhere and Look It\u2019s Getting Sunny Outside!!!, deal with his mother\u2019s schizophrenia. The latter series, in particular, hints at the visceral thrust of The Coast, but is grounded by a more intimate, tenderly observed approach. \u201cWhen my mother became ill,\u201d he says, \u201cit seemed like the end of my world.\u201d The Coast marks a distinct shift in approach and attitude insofar as it utterly disregards the conventions of traditional documentary photography.

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It follows a security crackdown in Indian-administered Kashmir, where extra troops have been deployed and thousands of pilgrims and tourists were abruptly evacuated at the weekend.</p> \n<p>In the early hours of Monday, Kashmiri leaders said they had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/05/kashmir-leaders-placed-under-arrest-amid-security-crackdown\">placed under house arrest</a>, internet and phone coverage to Kashmir valley was cut, public gatherings were banned and schools closed.</p> \n<p>The government sought to revoke the state\u2019s special status through a presidential order on Monday, which will be voted on by the lower house of parliament, controlled by Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).

      "bodyText": "India is set to withdraw the special status of the disputed territory of Kashmir and split the state in two, in a move likely to face major resistance in the Muslim-majority state and escalate tensions with Pakistan. The proposal, which has been advocated by Hindu nationalists for decades, is the most radical change any government has suggested for Kashmir\u2019s status since the region was granted autonomy in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947. It follows a security crackdown in Indian-administered Kashmir, where extra troops have been deployed and thousands of pilgrims and tourists were abruptly evacuated at the weekend. In the early hours of Monday, Kashmiri leaders said they had been placed under house arrest, internet and phone coverage to Kashmir valley was cut, public gatherings were banned and schools closed. The government sought to revoke the state\u2019s special status through a presidential order on Monday, which will be voted on by the lower house of parliament, controlled by Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). A government source said the vote was a technicality and the proposals were a done deal. Mehbooba Mufti, Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s former chief minister who was once in alliance with the BJP, tweeted that the government announcement would \u201cmake India an occupational force in Jammu and Kashmir \u2026 Today marks the darkest day in Indian democracy.\u201d The BJP has repeatedly pledged to scrap Kashmir\u2019s special status but this is the first time a concrete proposal has been tabled. The announcement could define Modi\u2019s legacy as prime minister. However, it is expected to lead to a furious reaction from Pakistan, which also claims the territory. Two of the three wars India and Pakistan have fought since their independence from British rule have been over Kashmir. On Monday, about 28 miles (45km) from the contested border, in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, dozens of protesters held black flags and burned car tyres, chanting: \u201cDown with India\u201d, according to reports by Reuters. Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said it would \u201cexercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps\u201d taken by India. The foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said the issue would also be raised with allies, including the US. The move could also fuel the insurgency in Kashmir, which has continued for the past three decades and has left more than 70,000 people dead, mainly civilians. The legal basis for the move is unclear as some analysts argue that according to the constitution, the consent of the state legislature is required to revoke Kashmir\u2019s status. Amid shouting in India\u2019s parliament on Monday, the interior minister, Amit Shah, proposed the abolition of Kashmir\u2019s special status, which is guaranteed under Article 370. This grants the state its own constitution and autonomy over all matters except for areas such as foreign affairs and defence. Another provision, which prevents people from outside the state buying land in the territory, will also disappear. Many Kashmiris believe this rule is crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state. A government source said the change would bring the state\u2019s laws in line with those of India and was crucial to ensuring development in Kashmir, which it said had been stifled by land ownership rules. Currently, the state of Jammu and Kashmir comprises three regions: Hindu-majority Jammu, Muslim-majority Kashmir and Buddhist-majority Ladakh. Shah said the government had decided to split the state into two union territories: Jammu and Kashmir, which will have a legislature; and Ladakh, which will be ruled directly by the central government without a legislature of its own. The announcement was welcomed by Modi\u2019s Hindu-nationalist supporters, who say that the provisions made under article 370 were only ever intended to be temporary. But others accused the government of failing to listen to the will of Kashmiri people and condemned the manner in which the government appeared to prepare for the announcement, by placing Kashmir on lockdown. Over the weekend, panicked people across Kashmir, many of whom will be celebrating Eid next week, queued for hours outside petrol stations and cash machines. After the announcement on Monday, Indian media reports said a further 8,000 troops had been deployed to Kashmir, bolstering its already heavy military presence. In the early hours of Monday, Mufti and Sajad Lone, the president of the People\u2019s Conference party, were among several politicians reporting they had been placed under house arrest. Omar Abdullah, the scion of a prominent political family in Kashmir and former chief minister in the state, said on Sunday evening he believed he would be placed under house arrest. It is unclear when the security measures will be lifted in Kashmir, where a communications blackout remains. Sanjay Kak, a documentary film-maker whose family are Kashmiri, said he was unable to contact his parents. \u201cAs of last night we had no contact and we don\u2019t expect to for several days.

He returned from Kashmir on Sunday and said the mood was unprecedented, adding that no one knew what was happening.
