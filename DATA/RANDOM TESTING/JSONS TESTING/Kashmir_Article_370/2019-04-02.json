A Labour spokesman said: \u201cThe circumstances of last night\u2019s votes were exceptional. But it\u2019s clear we need to find common ground in parliament to stop either a disastrous no-deal Brexit or the prime minister\u2019s botched deal.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has been challenged over party discipline at a shadow cabinet meeting for allowing his frontbench allies Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett to vote against a second referendum in defiance of a three-line whip. Shadow cabinet sources said the Labour leader was tackled multiple times during Tuesday\u2019s meeting over the lack of frontbench unity, amid calls from backbench MPs for Lavery and Trickett to be sacked. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, is understood to have suggested the situation was unfair when she had followed the three-line whip despite having reservations about a second referendum. One shadow cabinet source said she had not been criticising Lavery and Trickett for their stance on the issue but had wanted to raise the lack of clarity over how abstentions would be dealt with, as well as the party\u2019s shift towards apparently straightforwardly supporting a backbench second referendum motion rather than having its own more nuanced position. Four other shadow cabinet sources said the issue of discipline was raised numerous times without mentioning Trickett and Lavery by name but it was obvious what was being referenced. Indirect criticism came from Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, who stressed the importance of shadow cabinet unity and facing up to difficult choices. It is understood Corbyn did not give an answer and said it would be dealt with later in the meeting by Nick Brown, the chief whip, who also gave no explanation. Lavery, the party chair, and Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, were both present but did not speak on the subject. Gloria De Piero, a shadow justice minister and MP for Ashfield, also abstained. She explained her position on Twitter: \u201cAshfield delegates voted against a second referendum at Labour conference. Many Ashfield members voted to leave the EU. None of this is easy but we should recognise that Labour membership in towns like Ashfield is so much smaller so their voice can\u2019t compete with mass memberships in big cities.\u201d Before last week\u2019s votes, Corbyn\u2019s spokesman stressed the unique, non-binding nature of the process. A Labour spokesman said: \u201cThe circumstances of last night\u2019s votes were exceptional. But it\u2019s clear we need to find common ground in parliament to stop either a disastrous no-deal Brexit or the prime minister\u2019s botched deal. Labour is well placed to lead these efforts as our MPs represent constituencies that voted both leave and remain. It is now a matter for the leader and the whips.\u201d Trickett, Lavery and Rayner were among a large group of shadow cabinet ministers who went to see Corbyn last week to protest against the party\u2019s decision to whip for a second referendum. Corbyn subsequently issued a letter to Labour MPs saying the party was only recommending voting for a referendum to keep the option on the table, as the party\u2019s conference policy demanded. The indicative vote on a second, confirmatory referendum for any Brexit deal lost by a margin of only 12, with 16 Labour MPs \u2013 including Lavery and Trickett \u2013 abstaining and 24 voting against, mostly representing leave-dominated seats. Several backbench Labour MPs called for Lavery and Trickett to lose their jobs. Neil Coyle, a backbench Labour MP, told PoliticsHome: \u201cIt\u2019s clear the party chair has a problem representing members\u2019 views, sadly. But Ian is not a backbencher representing a local concern. He is supposed to be the voice of members up and down the country at the top table of the Labour party. \u201cIf you\u2019re supposed to be chair of the Labour party but your votes align more closely with the ERG than with Labour members then it\u2019s obviously time to go.\u201d Former frontbencher Ian Murray also said: \u201cYou either serve in the shadow cabinet or you break the whip.

It\u2019s ridiculous and is a slap in the face to those who do comply in the shadow cabinet and is an act of extreme disloyalty to the leadership.\u201d There were also recriminations on Tuesday between soft Brexiters and those in the people\u2019s vote campaign who rejected less hardline alternatives to Theresa May\u2019s deal such as the customs union and common market 2.0. The vote for Brexit with a customs union was lost by just three votes, with 10 Labour MPs ticking the \u201cno\u201d box on the voting forms. These were mainly from leave seats, but also included the remainer Owen Smith. Three abstained, all from the party\u2019s remain wing. With common market 2.0, which the Labour leadership decided to back, 25 of its MPs defied the whip, again mainly from leave seats along with Smith, and 33 others abstained. Sources in the People\u2019s Vote campaign defended their decision not to back soft Brexit options, saying allowing them to go through would have killed off the second referendum campaign entirely.",

Supporters of a customs union \u2013 which lost by just three votes \u2013 blamed Lib Dems, the Independent Group and Labour backers of a referendum for withholding their support and denying parliament the opportunity to force May to compromise.

A source close to the Independent Group said there was a real risk that a win for a customs union in the House of Commons could have scuppered the chances of a new poll and that referendum supporters had already compromised by supporting the indicative votes process, which put their preferred option at risk.

      "bodyText": "Burger King is trialling a meat-free version of its famous Whopper, rolling out the new \u201cImpossible Whopper\u201d at 59 restaurants in St Louis. The meatless burger, developed with Impossible Foods, a California-based company that makes plant-based substitutes, is designed to \u201cbleed\u201d like a conventional burger, and uses genetically modified yeast to produce heme, a protein that mimics the flavor of meat. Burger King insists the new plant-based alternative tastes as good as the real thing. Christopher Finazzo, the chain\u2019s North America president, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve done sort of a blind taste test with our franchisees, with people in the office, with my partners on the executive team, and virtually nobody can tell the difference.\u201d Burger King has offered a veggie burger for years. But the difference between the veggie option and the new no-meat Whopper may be that meat-eaters are more willing to try it. The chain says it will still put mayonnaise on the Whopper\u2019s twin and claims the meat-free patty is not only for those following a plant-based diet. White Castle, the US burger chain known for tiny, square sliders, currently sells the Impossible Burger product in more than 370 restaurants, and the chain has reported better-than-expected sales. Impossible Foods has at least one major competitor, Beyond Meat, which sells its Beyond Burger at Carl\u2019s Jr and A&amp;W restaurants in Canada. Beyond Meat will be the first of Silicon Valley\u2019s new generation of food companies to go public. Its initial public offering this spring is expected to raise roughly $150m, analysts told the Guardian, even as the company loses $29.9m per year in its efforts to expand. Burger King\u2019s new burger may not please budget-conscious customers, though. It will sell the Impossible Burger for about a dollar more than the beef version \u2013 in part because of the difficulty plant-based companies have had matching cheap meat prices. Beyond Meat\u2019s burger is also more expensive than most beef alternatives. Impossible Foods\u2019 main pitch is for environmental sustainability. Intensive animal agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gas, water use and pollution. But the burger has not been immune from criticism. Genetically modified yeast, a lack of organic ingredients, processed soy, and a high saturated fat and salt content have concerned some critics. And the burger has been criticized by animal rights activists for testing products on rats. Cattle ranchers have also mounted opposition to Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat for selling patties in grocery stores in the same refrigerators as meat. Nestl\u00e9 this week announced it would also try its hand at manufacturing a plant-based burger. It will launch the \u201cIncredible Burger\u201d in Europe and the \u201cAwesome Burger\u201d in the US this fall, according to Reuters. The plant-based industry is expected to grow to $10bn in the next five years, according to analysts. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 April 2019 to clarify that the Impossible Whopper is a plant-based burger, but is not vegan.",

      "body": "<p>On a grubby stretch of Peckham Road, just down from a replica of Del Boy\u2019s van from Only Fools and Horses, stands an old sausage factory. Inside are gardens, beehives , bonsai trees, tables covered in fresh rose petals and a room full of Japanese flower arrangements. Here, assistants labour painstakingly over some of the most eye-popping paintings being produced today. This is the home and studio of Raqib Shaw, a 45-year-old Indian artist, whose hyperreal and crazily detailed visions of gods, fairytales, impossible architecture and paradises lost and found, emerge in paintings and sculptures that can take up to three years to produce \u2013 even with the help of an eight-strong team (more if there\u2019s an exhibition in the offing).</p> <p>It\u2019s my second visit to Shaw\u2019s decadent London domain. <a href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/story/raqib-shaw-garden-of-earthly-delights\">Five years ago</a> I spent a Sunday afternoon having enormous glasses of pink champagne thrust into my hand while Shaw declared that he spent \u00a320,000 a month on flowers, and said that it was a point of honour for him to be heavily in debt at all times (\u201cin the red, darling \u2013 red is the colour of fashion\u201d). He showed me works he was making: visions of exploding buildings and fantastical beasts disporting themselves in temples and gardens.</p> <p>One work was commissioned by a collector: writhing naked male monsters sculpted in stone, topped off with a glass plinth at chest height. I finally reeled out with a pot of pink hydrangeas as a parting gift \u2013 which, happily, still bloom today. \u201cPut fertiliser in them and they\u2019ll turn a vibrant blue,\u201d Shaw advises me when I tell him. Improving nature is one of his favourite activities.</p> <p>On a Friday afternoon in January, things are calmer. Tea is offered rather than booze, and the garden, which was a riot of butterflies before, has a midwinter dormancy. Shaw says that part of the reason for the hysteria of my last visit was that he had felt he had become too caught up in the need to feed the art market.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"11617716059ae9211c7f4966e3a74398fc6d20a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11617716059ae9211c7f4966e3a74398fc6d20a3/134_146_2141_2598/824.jpg\" alt=\"Allegory of Memories through Monozukuri by Raqib Shaw.\" width=\"824\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allegory of Memories through Monozukuri by Raqib Shaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raqib Shaw, courtesy Pace Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was an absolute mess and there was great turmoil \u2013 I felt betrayed,\u201d Shaw declares (he says everything with a declamatory flourish, punctuated by machine-gun howls of laughter). \u201cThe holiest thing in the whole world is your dedication towards art and then you realise that there\u2019s the market and they\u2019re just fucking trade, everyone\u2019s a fucking prostitute. It\u2019s the blight, the cancer of the art world and creativity, this making mediocre work to feed the market. Art has to be a bit more serious than that, I think.\u201d</p> <p>This new seriousness is reflected in his latest paintings, which go on show at Pace gallery in New York this week. The exhibition is called Landscapes and consists of 18 enormous, insanely intricate works, many to be displayed one per room, but some of which I view standing on a ladder, as they\u2019re lying flat, the paint still wet. They are inspired by old masters ranging from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/constable\">Constable</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/21/gainsboroughs-family-album-review\">Gainsborough</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/feb/19/artsfeatures2\">Caspar David Friedrich</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/pieter-bruegel-the-elder\">Bruegel the Elder</a>, yet are as hyperreal as a CGI-driven Hollywood blockbuster. One set depicts a life cycle from childhood to death. First, there is a luscious valley bedecked with cherry blossoms (Spring), then a scene of \u201cchampagne and indulgence\u201d set against a ravine, with a rabbit as a nod to Alice in Wonderland (Summer).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>While living in then-ungentrified Islington, he came upon human remains. 'Sweets,' he says, 'I saw a foot!'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Autumn depicts Shaw in a hermit\u2019s hut in a spectacular valley, while in the winter painting Allegory of Memories through Monozukuri, the artist desolately ponders the previous scenes in a snowy courtyard, his dogs Minty and Mr C at his feet, a portrait of \u201cabsolute psychological isolation\u201d. He adds: \u201cI think they are the most honest paintings I\u2019ve made. I\u2019m trying to deal with the many masks I\u2019ve been used to wearing all my life and trying to find out who I am. These paintings are my experiences in life \u2013 a diary of myself.\u201d</p> <p>With its extravagance and excess, Shaw\u2019s work will not be to everyone\u2019s taste, yet demands to be taken seriously for its sincerity, its technique and its singular point of view. Or as he puts it: \u201cI exist because these paintings need to be created.\u201d As well as their old-master inspiration, the works are influenced by art from India, Japan, Germany, the Persian empire and myriad other places. They are made on birch wood with enamel and Hammerite paint \u2013 the stuff you use on cars \u2013 pushing it far beyond pastiche.</p> <p>After a photoshoot, Shaw makes drawings that are translated on to acetates, which are then projected on to the painting surface, then drawn in stained glass liner, lines that are then painstakingly filled in with paint applied with porcupine quills or, in the most recent paintings, needles. \u201cIf this painting was painted in oil it would be absolutely ridiculous \u2013 it would make no sense whatsoever,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cIt goes back to the seminar I had at Saint Martins where it was all about finding your material and your personal language. Let\u2019s not forget, Hammerite enamel is not supposed to be blended. To make it sing like a proper painting is, I think, quite interesting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f2cb19a77636a7f664bf73575223efe4c9d859bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2cb19a77636a7f664bf73575223efe4c9d859bd/127_106_2743_2609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Four Seasons \u2018Spring\u2019 by Raqib Shaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"951\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spring from The Four Seasons by Raqib Shaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Raqib Shaw, courtesy Pace Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there\u2019s the paradise lost to which Shaw keeps returning \u2013 the hugely disputed territory of Kashmir in northern India, which he describes as \u201cparadise on earth\u201d, long a site of conflict between India, Pakistan and China. Shaw was born there in 1974 to a family of Muslim merchants; in 1989, there was a civil war, in which the Hindu and Pandit population were forced to leave by Muslim fundamentalists. Shaw\u2019s family cleared out, too \u2013 \u201cit was too dangerous\u201d \u2013 and relocated to New Delhi. Shaw has not been back for 21 years, and considers himself exiled from his home: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like a refugee everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>In 1993, having been inspired to become an artist after seeing Holbein\u2019s The Ambassadors on a trip to London, Shaw enrolled at Central Saint Martins art school, much to his family\u2019s displeasure. Instead of selling carpets and jewels as they had hoped, Shaw spent much of his time in London squatting in a derelict school in a then-ungentrified Islington (at one point he came upon human remains - \u201cSweets, I saw a foot!\u201d), washing in a kids\u2019 paddling pool and developing his work.</p> <p>Shortly after graduating, he was talent-spotted by the art dealer Victoria Miro, and since then has shown at Tate Britain in London, the Met in New York and, last year, the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh, in an exhibition called <a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/raqib-shaw-reinventing-old-masters\">Reinventing the Old Masters</a>. His work is possibly too bonkers to have enjoyed unalloyed critical acclaim (his big champion is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/nov/25/art.artsfeatures\">Norman Rosenthal</a>, formerly exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy). Not that Shaw cares about art critics \u2013 in his view, it will only be in 100 years that we\u2019ll know whether or not his art was worthwhile, and by then, he\u2019ll be long dead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6aa22538b7199dbde6b14e1342c39f1b8dc56a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6aa22538b7199dbde6b14e1342c39f1b8dc56a6/122_90_2602_2204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Narcissus to Icarus (After De\u0301jeuner sur l\u2019herbe) by Raqib Shaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"847\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Narcissus to Icarus (After De\u0301jeuner sur l\u2019herbe) by Raqib Shaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raqib Shaw, courtesy Pace Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On my previous visit he showed me his collection of bonsai trees, each the value of a modest car. Today, they are somewhat depleted. \u201cThis is my shame \u2013 because of my lack of experience I killed them. This one had a big infestation which I wasn\u2019t able to treat in time. This one died because I went to Paris and there was a heatwave.\u201d Now he\u2019s taken up the Japanese art of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/t-magazine/ikebana-japanese-flower-art.html\">ikebana</a>, an extremely minimal form of flower arranging which takes 20 years to master, and perhaps the antithesis of the maximalist aesthetic of his own paintings. \u201cThe whole idea is the negative space, which doesn\u2019t really exist in my work, but I want to see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>At 45, Shaw has decided to devote his life to art. \u201cAlex, what does an ageing, good-for-nothing homosexual have to do, my dear? I have to fucking give meaning to something because I\u2019ve never had a partner. I\u2019ve never been in love! I\u2019m not sure that I have great confidence in human relationships. I think one has to be extremely lucky to find the right one, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to spend my time looking for things and pining after them \u2013 I would rather make some creative use of my wretched life!\u201d He howls with laughter.</p> <p>Why not just go on Grindr? \u201cI don\u2019t know my dear, I think I\u2019m too much of a romantic. I think it\u2019s all the damned Victorian literature I read when I was growing up \u2013 the Wuthering Heights mentality.\u201d And indeed Shaw\u2019s work is suffused with longing \u2013 for love, for Kashmir, for an idyll to which he can never return. The crazy extravagance of the work aestheticises emotions that would otherwise be too painful to bear. Shaw has survived cancer and periods of depression: \u201cBut Alex, I\u2019m not being romantic about it, my dear. I think the paintings wouldn\u2019t be the way they are if I did not have a generally miserable life.\u201d</p> <p>In person, Shaw doesn\u2019t seem miserable \u2013 in fact, he\u2019s a hoot. He and his team seem very fond of one another, and a table in one room is thickly covered with rose petals for a friend\u2019s birthday dinner he hosted the night before. Nonetheless, Shaw says he is a loner. He says he had the perfect Christmas \u2013 21 days on his own with nothing to do but read Nietzsche\u2019s Also Sprach Zarathustra.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"358789428951ff6186fa82ac6161eb3f5e04ad82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/358789428951ff6186fa82ac6161eb3f5e04ad82/173_184_2632_1956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ode to the Valley of Wonderment by Raqib Shaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"743\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ode to the Valley of Wonderment by Raqib Shaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raqib Shaw, courtesy Pace Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou have to come to terms with loneliness one way or the other,\u201d he says, \u201cso I\u2019m trying to cram it all up with things to do and the challenges of beauty and it seems to work. There\u2019s always this unconscious desire to be fashionable or accepted, and I really don\u2019t care any more because I\u2019m on this very solitary journey.\u201d</p> <p>His little oasis is a bulwark against reality, filled, some evenings, with opera singers, artists and other like-minded souls. Two years ago, however, one of these evenings ended in disaster when a candle set alight a wall of dried hydrangeas, and the lower studio burned down, taking a painting with it (\u201cthe whole thing was gone, absolutely cleared\u201d). There was, however, a silver lining. \u201cOh God, it\u2019s not a myth about firemen,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cThese gods! I told them I\u2019d sprained my foot and they carried me out \u2013 three of them! Oh, what a desperate bitch. They said, \u2018Are you OK there?\u2019 And I said \u2018No, the other foot has gone as well!\u2019\u201d He screams with laughter.</p> <p>No losses, he says, can compare to his exile from Kashmir. The final work in the Pace show is a drawing of a man in a tower, engrossed in his work, while a bomber strikes the landscape outside. \u201cSo you have natural disasters, the planet being fucked, humans killing other humans and calling ourselves very civilised, and then there is me, privileged to be able to make a work in peace, in this golden cage which is basically a glorified prison.\u201d</p> <p>Though it\u2019s said with his usual flamboyance, it\u2019s plain that Shaw is sincere. \u201cI do believe that art can still be sincere, art can still be holy, art can still be sacred.\u201d Then he brays with laughter once more \u2013 and turns the conversation to Love Island.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.pacegallery.com/exhibitions/13030/raqib-shaw-landscapes\">Raqib Shaw: Landscapes is at Pace Gallery, New York, from 5 April to 18 May</a>.</p></li> </ul>",

Art has to be a bit more serious than that, I think.\u201d This new seriousness is reflected in his latest paintings, which go on show at Pace gallery in New York this week. The exhibition is called Landscapes and consists of 18 enormous, insanely intricate works, many to be displayed one per room, but some of which I view standing on a ladder, as they\u2019re lying flat, the paint still wet. They are inspired by old masters ranging from Constable and Gainsborough to Caspar David Friedrich and Bruegel the Elder, yet are as hyperreal as a CGI-driven Hollywood blockbuster. One set depicts a life cycle from childhood to death. First, there is a luscious valley bedecked with cherry blossoms (Spring), then a scene of \u201cchampagne and indulgence\u201d set against a ravine, with a rabbit as a nod to Alice in Wonderland (Summer). Autumn depicts Shaw in a hermit\u2019s hut in a spectacular valley, while in the winter painting Allegory of Memories through Monozukuri, the artist desolately ponders the previous scenes in a snowy courtyard, his dogs Minty and Mr C at his feet, a portrait of \u201cabsolute psychological isolation\u201d. He adds: \u201cI think they are the most honest paintings I\u2019ve made. I\u2019m trying to deal with the many masks I\u2019ve been used to wearing all my life and trying to find out who I am. These paintings are my experiences in life \u2013 a diary of myself.\u201d With its extravagance and excess, Shaw\u2019s work will not be to everyone\u2019s taste, yet demands to be taken seriously for its sincerity, its technique and its singular point of view. Or as he puts it: \u201cI exist because these paintings need to be created.\u201d As well as their old-master inspiration, the works are influenced by art from India, Japan, Germany, the Persian empire and myriad other places. They are made on birch wood with enamel and Hammerite paint \u2013 the stuff you use on cars \u2013 pushing it far beyond pastiche. After a photoshoot, Shaw makes drawings that are translated on to acetates, which are then projected on to the painting surface, then drawn in stained glass liner, lines that are then painstakingly filled in with paint applied with porcupine quills or, in the most recent paintings, needles. \u201cIf this painting was painted in oil it would be absolutely ridiculous \u2013 it would make no sense whatsoever,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cIt goes back to the seminar I had at Saint Martins where it was all about finding your material and your personal language. Let\u2019s not forget, Hammerite enamel is not supposed to be blended. To make it sing like a proper painting is, I think, quite interesting.\u201d Then there\u2019s the paradise lost to which Shaw keeps returning \u2013 the hugely disputed territory of Kashmir in northern India, which he describes as \u201cparadise on earth\u201d, long a site of conflict between India, Pakistan and China. Shaw was born there in 1974 to a family of Muslim merchants; in 1989, there was a civil war, in which the Hindu and Pandit population were forced to leave by Muslim fundamentalists. Shaw\u2019s family cleared out, too \u2013 \u201cit was too dangerous\u201d \u2013 and relocated to New Delhi. Shaw has not been back for 21 years, and considers himself exiled from his home: \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like a refugee everywhere.\u201d In 1993, having been inspired to become an artist after seeing Holbein\u2019s The Ambassadors on a trip to London, Shaw enrolled at Central Saint Martins art school, much to his family\u2019s displeasure. Instead of selling carpets and jewels as they had hoped, Shaw spent much of his time in London squatting in a derelict school in a then-ungentrified Islington (at one point he came upon human remains - \u201cSweets, I saw a foot!\u201d), washing in a kids\u2019 paddling pool and developing his work. Shortly after graduating, he was talent-spotted by the art dealer Victoria Miro, and since then has shown at Tate Britain in London, the Met in New York and, last year, the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh, in an exhibition called Reinventing the Old Masters. His work is possibly too bonkers to have enjoyed unalloyed critical acclaim (his big champion is Norman Rosenthal, formerly exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy). Not that Shaw cares about art critics \u2013 in his view, it will only be in 100 years that we\u2019ll know whether or not his art was worthwhile, and by then, he\u2019ll be long dead. On my previous visit he showed me his collection of bonsai trees, each the value of a modest car. Today, they are somewhat depleted. \u201cThis is my shame \u2013 because of my lack of experience I killed them. This one had a big infestation which I wasn\u2019t able to treat in time. This one died because I went to Paris and there was a heatwave.\u201d Now he\u2019s taken up the Japanese art of ikebana, an extremely minimal form of flower arranging which takes 20 years to master, and perhaps the antithesis of the maximalist aesthetic of his own paintings. \u201cThe whole idea is the negative space, which doesn\u2019t really exist in my work, but I want to see what happens.\u201d At 45, Shaw has decided to devote his life to art. \u201cAlex, what does an ageing, good-for-nothing homosexual have to do, my dear? I have to fucking give meaning to something because I\u2019ve never had a partner. I\u2019ve never been in love! I\u2019m not sure that I have great confidence in human relationships. I think one has to be extremely lucky to find the right one, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to spend my time looking for things and pining after them \u2013 I would rather make some creative use of my wretched life!\u201d He howls with laughter. Why not just go on Grindr? \u201cI don\u2019t know my dear, I think I\u2019m too much of a romantic. I think it\u2019s all the damned Victorian literature I read when I was growing up \u2013 the Wuthering Heights mentality.\u201d And indeed Shaw\u2019s work is suffused with longing \u2013 for love, for Kashmir, for an idyll to which he can never return. The crazy extravagance of the work aestheticises emotions that would otherwise be too painful to bear. Shaw has survived cancer and periods of depression: \u201cBut Alex, I\u2019m not being romantic about it, my dear. I think the paintings wouldn\u2019t be the way they are if I did not have a generally miserable life.\u201d In person, Shaw doesn\u2019t seem miserable \u2013 in fact, he\u2019s a hoot. He and his team seem very fond of one another, and a table in one room is thickly covered with rose petals for a friend\u2019s birthday dinner he hosted the night before. Nonetheless, Shaw says he is a loner. He says he had the perfect Christmas \u2013 21 days on his own with nothing to do but read Nietzsche\u2019s Also Sprach Zarathustra. \u201cYou have to come to terms with loneliness one way or the other,\u201d he says, \u201cso I\u2019m trying to cram it all up with things to do and the challenges of beauty and it seems to work. There\u2019s always this unconscious desire to be fashionable or accepted, and I really don\u2019t care any more because I\u2019m on this very solitary journey.\u201d His little oasis is a bulwark against reality, filled, some evenings, with opera singers, artists and other like-minded souls. Two years ago, however, one of these evenings ended in disaster when a candle set alight a wall of dried hydrangeas, and the lower studio burned down, taking a painting with it (\u201cthe whole thing was gone, absolutely cleared\u201d). There was, however, a silver lining. \u201cOh God, it\u2019s not a myth about firemen,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cThese gods! I told them I\u2019d sprained my foot and they carried me out \u2013 three of them! Oh, what a desperate bitch. They said, \u2018Are you OK there?\u2019 And I said \u2018No, the other foot has gone as well!\u2019\u201d He screams with laughter. No losses, he says, can compare to his exile from Kashmir. The final work in the Pace show is a drawing of a man in a tower, engrossed in his work, while a bomber strikes the landscape outside. \u201cSo you have natural disasters, the planet being fucked, humans killing other humans and calling ourselves very civilised, and then there is me, privileged to be able to make a work in peace, in this golden cage which is basically a glorified prison.\u201d Though it\u2019s said with his usual flamboyance, it\u2019s plain that Shaw is sincere. \u201cI do believe that art can still be sincere, art can still be holy, art can still be sacred.\u201d Then he brays with laughter once more \u2013 and turns the conversation to Love Island. Raqib Shaw: Landscapes is at Pace Gallery, New York, from 5 April to 18 May.",

After that, it was management, and then he was going to study environmental economics on a scholarship at Cambridge (\u201cI got deeply interested in forest issues\u201d), but accepted a theatre scholarship instead. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave university,\u201d he says, and likens the research he undertakes for each play to completing a \u201cmini MPhil\u201d. For Pah-La, he began by reading about Tibetan Buddhism in Bengali (which is similar to the scriptural language, Pali) and about Chinese communism, before talking to Tibetans. \u201cI taught voluntary English classes in India first of all. I had some students who were monks. Then I managed to crack through to Chinese chatrooms and servers to talk with people in Tibet.\u201d His play features polygraph tests used on Tibetan prisoners. For this, he discovered sites where Mainland China traded in electrical equipment: \u201cI figured that a lot of polygraph machines were sold to Tibet around 2008, so I got in touch with people from the Hong Kong police and went into sites asking for quotes to buy the machines.\u201d Majumdar\u2019s processes sound more like those of a detective or an investigative reporter than a writer observing the world from a garret. For his Kashmir plays, he spent time in police bunkers and the dens of militants. For Pah-La, he decided he had to go to Lhasa, whatever the cost. While there, he and his wife Pallavi, a painter, traced part of the journey that Tibetans used to escape into exile. \u201cOne has to walk at night across the Himalayas, hiding from the Chinese soldiers.\u201d He is reluctant to give many more details, quipping: \u201cThat\u2019s another play!\u201d He was given an official guide on his arrival to Lhasa, who accompanied him wherever he went. \u201cMy work would start after the guide had left me at 8pm. I went into prisons with people who were taking in food. There were Chinese bars and Tibetan ones. I went to both. The things I found out were extraordinary. People can\u2019t even say the Dalai Lama\u2019s name in Tibet. You can be put in prison for saying, \u2018His Holiness the Dalai Lama.\u2019 So they said \u2018HH\u2019 for fear of being arrested.\u201d Majumdar recorded the phone numbers of his sources in a secret code and created maps that would not implicate those he spoke to in Lhasa. Yet he felt himself being watched when he returned to India. \u201cI\u2019m under an enormous amount of surveillance in Delhi. If I send an email to someone in Tibet today, it\u2019ll reach them the day after tomorrow.\u201d He has learned not to let it affect him too much, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve grown used to it. There was a guy who approached me in Delhi out of the blue.\u201d He thinks he was from some Chinese agency. \u201cThey knew I had gone into prisons [in Lhasa] and other things like that. The guy spoke in Hindi except for one phrase in English, when he said, \u2018Accidents happen in foreign countries.\u2019\u201d Given that Majumdar was just about to travel abroad, he took it as a barely veiled threat on his life. How did he respond? By switching back to Hindi and asking the man: \u201cIce-cream khao ge?\u201d (\u201cWould you like some ice-cream?\u201d) He shrugs. \u201cWhat other response can you have to a comment like that?\u201d If this was a low point, one of the highs came at an audience with the Dalai Lama. He was supposed to have 10 minutes, but the Dalai Lama was so engaged by the issues of Majumdar\u2019s play that their meeting stretched to an hour. \u201cWe spoke about many things. He told me to write fearlessly.\u201d Majumdar is working on a new play, called Baatin, that looks at the multiple meanings of the Qur\u2019an \u2013 to highlight its plurality and challenge the notion that Islam is a religion of violence. When it began as a faith, he says, \u201cthere were a few Arab men and women. If I had said at the time that I\u2019d seen a terrorist, everyone would think I was talking about a Christian.\u201d His research so far has taken him to Al-Azhar University, the centre for Islamic intellectual study in Cairo. He is not under any illusions about the difficulties of staging such politically charged material. \u201cRight now,\u201d he says, \u201cnobody wants to touch it.\u201d He is, as the Dalai Lama suggested, writing it fearlessly, anyway. \u2022 Pah-La is at the Royal Court, London, until 27 April.",

      "bodyText": "The House of Commons has once again succeeded in offering up \u201ca quite extraordinary spectacle of disorder, indecision and division\u201d, said France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration, as European media struggled to do justice to Westminster\u2019s Brexit chaos. There were \u201ctears, a resignation, insults\u201d and even \u201cbare bottoms glued to glass\u201d, the paper said, when \u2013 after a long debate interrupted by naked climate protesters \u2013 MPs \u201conce more rejected all available options for a way out of the impasse\u201d. Le Monde was even more apocalyptic. \u201cThe wholesale slaughter of Brexit continues,\u201d the paper said. Parliament, having dreamed of succeeding where Theresa May had failed, \u201cdisplayed its disunity, its impotence, even its irresponsibility\u201d. So what next? \u201cIn this devastated landscape,\u201d the paper said, \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s options are limited and all \u2013 excepting a miraculous fourth-round vote in favour of her deal \u2013 present mortal dangers for her government, herself or for the country\u201d. Should May be tempted by a no-deal Brexit, \u201can economic catastrophe but the goal of her more extremist ministers, the moderates in the government would resign, exposing her to a vote of confidence and the country to general elections\u201d, it said. \u201cShould, on the other hand, she try to find a compromise around a \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 that would leave Britain in closer proximity to the EU, the pro-Brexit hardliners in her team will walk out, with comparable consequences.\u201d Germany\u2019s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said the idea that the prime minister\u2019s thrice-defeated deal could go to a fourth vote had \u201ca certain grotesque quality, but it shows how great Britain\u2019s current helplessness is. This game, somewhere between paralysis and a political nervous breakdown, cannot go on for ever.\u201d At the moment, the paper said, \u201cthe divisions in the UK, among both voters and politicians, are so great that the country is digging itself further and further into a hole, making a mockery of itself to half the world. Brexit has torn the country in two, or at the very least laid bare its turmoil.\u201d Die Zeit said time was \u201cseriously starting to run out for an orderly Brexit\u201d. There was \u201ccurrently little indication that a new vote on the prime minister\u2019s exit deal would succeed\u201d. In addition, the paper reminded its readers, \u201ca fourth vote will depend on whether the Speaker, John Bercow, permits it\u201d. In the Netherlands, De Volkskrant said the \u201cjubilation in the lower house when it took control of the Brexit agenda was as great as the despair when it emerged there was, once more, no majority for an alternative Brexit\u201d. The time had come, the paper said, for May \u201cto pin her colours to the mast and lay her poor hand on the table. If she opts for no deal, she loses her pro-Europeans and the government collapses; ditto with a soft Brexit, except it would be the hardliners who go. Or she could dodge the choice and call new elections.\u201d Sweden\u2019s Dagens Nyheter said that realistically, the prime minister\u2019s options had now narrowed to two: \u201cGamble everything on yet another parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, or on new elections\u201d, while El Pa\u00eds in Spain said parliament had again shown it was \u201cfar easier to defeat Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan than to find an alternative\u201d. It saw the likeliest options as reduced to \u201ca request to the EU for a longer extension, of up to one year, to allow Britain to calmly seek a solution, or letting the deadlines pass and sending the country, next April 12, to a disorderly Brexit\u201d. Poland\u2019s Gazeta Wyborcza said that \u201cdespite Monday\u2019s fiasco, the parliamentary process has not yet been completely exhausted.

      "bodyText": "Up to 20 Conservatives could vote against the government in a confidence motion to stop a soft Brexit or a long delay, the former Brexit secretary David Davis has said. Davis, who did not rule out running for the party leadership, said significant numbers of MPs were prepared to put the delivery of Brexit above their party allegiance. His warning came as Theresa May\u2019s cabinet met on Tuesday morning, though the planned lengthy session has been shortened in light of the results of the indicative votes in the Commons. Instead, ministers will meet for two hours of political cabinet \u2013 without civil servants \u2013 and then for a normal cabinet meeting. On Monday night, MPs came within three votes of backing a post-Brexit customs union with the EU, but no Brexit option reached a majority. The cabinet meeting changes prompted speculation that ministers had previously believed they were heading for defeat. May had been expected to propose a runoff between her Brexit deal and any compromise option supported by a majority of MPs. The former minister Nick Boles, who spearheaded a drive to get MPs to back an alternative Norway-style deal dubbed \u201ccommon market 2.0\u201d, quit the party on the floor of the house, saying the Tories had never been prepared to compromise. Davis said a general election would not necessarily break the impasse. \u201cI would make one warning to the cabinet this morning: don\u2019t be sure every Conservative MP would vote for you if it was made a confidence vote,\u201d he said on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cOne or two have said already, I think there are probably 20 who would say [Brexit] is so important, it\u2019s the future of the country, it\u2019s our destiny at stake, it\u2019s more important than the Tory party.\u201d On Tuesday morning, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the UK had three options: agreement this week on the prime minister\u2019s deal or a variant of it, no deal, or a long extension to article 50. \u201cThe UK may ask for another extension. Such an extension would carry significant risks for the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore a strong justification would be needed. We have always said that we can accept a customs union, or relationship along the style of the Norway model.\u201d Davis said a long delay to Brexit \u201cwould tear apart\u201d the Conservative party. \u201cYou saw what happened last night with Nick Boles. You would see some bleeding away of people but \u2026 you would almost certainly have a leadership election and then all bets are off,\u201d he said. The Conservative MP Oliver Letwin, one of the key drivers behind the push for parliament to hold indicative votes on Brexit options, was expected to lay out his plans later on Tuesday for parliament to hold a fresh round of indicative votes on Wednesday. A number of Tory MPs have already publicly suggested they could vote against the prime minister in a confidence motion in order to force a change of leadership or a general election. Any Tory MP who voted against the government would be risking their chance of standing again as a Tory candidate. Steve Baker, a leading figure in the European Research Group of hard Brexiters, told the BBC the option of voting against the government in a confidence motion was possible. \u201cWe are approaching the point where the stakes are now so very high, and so transcend party politics and what this country is about and the fundamental British value that political power rests on consent, that I think these things are coming on to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point denying things are running away.\u201d",
