      "bodyText": "And finally, Wall Street has ended a good month on a low note. The Dow Jones industrial average has just closed down 69 points, or 0.27%, at 25,916. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq posted almost identical percentage falls #spooky. Each index also rose by around 3% during February, despite worries about economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions. Hopes that central banks will take a cautious approach to unwinding their stimulus measures cheered investors instead. While shares dipped, the dollar rose today - after thE US GDP figures came in stronger than expected. In London, the FTSE 100 ended 32 points lower at 7,074, a dip of 0.45%. Goodnight! Here\u2019s some more of today\u2019s business news: It\u2019s been a grim day for Aston Martin investors. Shares in the luxury carmaker slumped more than 20% after it revealed a loss for last year, due to the \u00a3136m cost of its stock market float. That float valued Aston\u2019s shares at \u00a319 each. They\u2019re now worth under \u00a311 - a shocking blow to anyone who put money into the IPO. President Obama\u2019s top economic advisor back in the day, Jason Furman, has tweeted some interesting points about today\u2019s US GDP report. Furman (hardly a Trump cheerleader) argues that the Q4 2018 vs Q4 2017 growth number gives a better picture than the 2018 vs 2017 one. That should please President Trump, as by that measure growth had just cleared the 3% hurdle (but not the 4% one!) However, Furman doesn\u2019t believe 3% growth is sustainable in the long term. Kay Daniel Neufeld, managing economist at the CEBR thinktank, is relieved that America avoided an abrupt slowdown in the last quarter. However, he also expects growth will be slower in 2019 - averaging 2.3% (again, below that 3% target). Neufeld writes: Contrary to most other large economies, the US has bucked the trend and recorded faster GDP growth in 2018 than in the previous year. The weak retail sales recorded for December alarmed analysts fearing an abrupt slowdown to the US expansion in the final quarter of last year, but today\u2019s stronger than expected GDP data suggest the December figures might have been a blip. Nevertheless, there is little room for complacency. With the world economy slowing and the US \u2013China trade conflict merely on hold, there are plenty of pitfalls to avoid if the US wants to achieve another stellar performance in 2019.\u201d The US has \u201cproved the doubters wrong\u201d by growing faster than expected in the last quarter of 2018, says James Knightley, ING\u2019s chief international economist. Here\u2019s his take: The details show a partial slowdown in consumer spending growth (2.8% versus 3.5% in 3Q18), but it continues to make a strong contribution. In fact, given the equity market turmoil at the time and the poor official retail sales figure for December, this isn\u2019t a bad outcome at all. Non-residential investment spending actually posted a decent performance, recording growth of 6.2% despite the concerns about what escalating trade tensions could mean in terms of supply chains and corporate profitability. However, net trade was a drag (-0.22 percentage points) in part for the same reason, as businesses looked to import supplies ahead of anticipated tariff hikes in January. Those additional tariffs were pulled in December as the US announced a temporary truce with China on trade, which has subsequently been extended by President Trump. Rounding out the numbers, residential investment was poor at -3.5% - the fourth consecutive quarterly contraction \u2013 while government spending grew by just 0.4% and inventories added just 0.13 percentage points to headline growth. Capital Economics fear that the US will slow in 2019, as the sugar rush from the White House tax cuts programme fades. Paul Ashworth, their chief US economist, says: Overall, GDP increased by 2.9% last year, up from 2.2% in 2017. But that acceleration is no surprise given the size of the fiscal stimulus introduced early last year. As the stimulus fades and the lagged impact of past monetary tightening continues to feed through, we expect GDP growth to slow to 2.2% this year and only 1.2% in 2020. Under those circumstances, we don\u2019t expect the Fed to hike rates again and we anticipate 75bp of rate cuts in 2020. Ashworth has also spotted signs that the government shutdown hurt the economy. Government expenditures increased by 0.4%, but that gain was dragged down by a 5.6% decline in Federal non-defence expenditure, which could be related to the shutdown that began in late December. Slightly more positively, the US economy grew by 3.1% in Q4 2018 compared to Q4 2017. Confusingly, that\u2019s a different figure than for 2018 growth [2.9%] as a whole (even though it sounds like it\u2019s measuring the same thing). Here\u2019s how the Bureau of Economic Analysis explain it: Real GDP increased 2.9 percent in 2018 (from the 2017 annual level to the 2018 annual level), compared with an increase of 2.2 percent in 2017.... During 2018 (measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018), real GDP increased 3.1 percent, compared with an increase of 2.5 percent during 2017. Cue a loud bunfight on social media, as one side claims we should use the 2.9% figure, and the other the 3.1%..... Back in December 2017, president Trump bullishly suggested the US economy could grow by \u201cfour, five, and maybe even six percent\u201d per year eventually. Now we know the US economy only grew by 2.9% last year. So, stronger growth -- like a China trade deal and North Korean denuclearisation -- are still on the White House \u2018To Do\u201d list. During 2018 as a whole the US economy grew by 2.9%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis says, up from 2.2% in 2017. That means that Donald Trump has just fallen short of his goal of achieving 3% sustainable growth, something he pledged during his 2016 election campaign. He was undone by the slowdown in the first quarter of last year, when bitterly cold weather gripped the economy. Growth accelerated in the second quarter, partly thanks to the president\u2019s tax cuts plan, but has now slipped back. You can see the details online here. Consumer spending helped to drive US growth in the last quarter, rising by 2.8%. Business spending on new equipment also boosted growth, rising by 6.2%. Firms also expanded their inventories a little, which is also positive for GDP. On the downside, trade had a negative impact on growth, with export growth slowing and imports holding up. That may indicate president Trump\u2019s trade war is causing some economic damage. Newsflash: America\u2019s economy has slowed, but not by as much as feared. US GDP expanded at an annual rate of 2.6% in the last quarter of 2018, official figures show. That\u2019s down from 3.4% annualised growth in July-September 2018. Economists had expected growth to slow to around 2.2%, annualised. A 2.6% annualised growth rate equates to a quarterly rate of around 0.65%. So while America\u2019s growth rate has slowed, it\u2019s still doing better than the UK, which only expanded by 0.2% in the last quarter, and Germany which stagnated. More to follow Here\u2019s Richard Partington on today\u2019s migration figures: Just in: India\u2019s growth rate has hit its lowest in over a year, in the latest sign that the world economy has cooled. Indian GDP rose by 6.6% per year in October-December, official figures show. Although that sounds like a solid result, its below forecasts of 6.9% growth for the quarter. It\u2019s also sharply lower than the 7.1% annual growth posted in the third-quarter. India\u2019s agricultural sector posted disappointing growth; poor rainfall in the crucial monsoon season hurt farmers. Manufacturing growth was also below forecasts. Here\u2019s some snap reaction: The big economic news of the day comes at 1.30pm GMT, when US growth figures for October-December 2018 are released . They\u2019ll probably show a sharp slowdown compared with Q3 (but still faster than the UK and the eurozone). We\u2019ve already had some encouraging growth figures from Sweden: gross domestic product grew 2.4% year-on-year, beating forecasts of 1.5% growth. But Brazil is finding conditions tougher. Its GDP only rose by 0.1% in the last quarter, meaning annual growth of just 1.1%. That shows the challenge facing new right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro (whose nationalism and determination to develop the Amazon is causing ructions). One more interesting chart from the ONS\u2019s migration report (which is online here) The respected Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford points out that net EU migration has now fallen 70% since the EU referendum. Madeleine Sumption, Director of the Migration Observatory, says Britain simply isn\u2019t as attractive to EU migrants than in 2016, for several reasons: That may be because of Brexit-related political uncertainty, the falling value of the pound making UK wages less attractive, or simply the fact that job opportunities have improved in other EU countries. EU net migration happened to be unusually high in the run-up to the referendum, so at least some of this decline would probably have happened anyway even without Brexit.\u201d The ONS also reports that more people are coming to the UK to study: immigration to the UK for work has fallen to its lowest level since 2014; this follows a fall in the number of EU citizens arriving to work the overall number of people arriving in the UK to study has increased, with non-EU student immigration at its highest level since 2011 Here\u2019s Matthew Fell, the CBI\u2019s chief UK policy director, on the drop in EU migration: Stephen Clarke, Senior Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, says EU workers are voting with their feet, and quitting the UK: \u201cWhile UK politicians are seemingly unable to provide any clarity on where Britain is heading post-Brexit, EU migrants are increasingly doing so \u2013 by leaving. \u201cEU migration is now at its lowest level in a decade \u2013 a fall that is being driven by fewer EU migrants coming to the UK for work. In contrast, migration from the rest of the world is close to a record high, though many of these migrants are coming to study rather than work. Clarke also believes that EU migration will continue to decline, creating new challenges for businesses who rely on it. \u201cPost-Brexit Britain\u2019s migration system is still to be decided, and is years away from coming into effect. But many areas of the labour market \u2013 particularly firms in high-turnover sectors like hospitality who are reliant on the free movement of EU workers \u2013 are going to have to adjust to lower migration well before the new system is in place.\u201d Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway has spotted that net migration from European countries to the UK is now lower than before the EU\u2019s major expansion in 2004: Tej Parikh, Senior Economist at the Institute of Directors, says today\u2019s migration figures show that firms are struggling to hire workers in the face of Brexit uncertainty. \u201cWith job vacancies at record highs, recruiting from abroad has never been more crucial for British businesses. Flexible and hassle-free access to international skillsets is part and parcel of having a globally competitive skills regime, so adjusting to the Government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration agenda, with its new restrictions, will present some challenges. \u201cAlready, firms across the retail, hospitality and construction sectors are facing obstacles as some EU workers are returning home, while it\u2019s also becoming harder to attract labour from Europe amidst the uncertain political climate. Larger organisations have looked to hire from further afield to compensate, despite the additional paper work, but this can be harder for many resource-constrained SMEs. \u201cBusinesses will be hoping immigration policy moves beyond political footballing and realises the importance of international workers, of all skillsets, for our Industrial Strategy.\u201d The latest UK migration statistics are out, and they give a fascinating insight into the changes that are taking place since the Brexit vote. Total migration was \u201cbroadly stable\u201d in the 12 months to September 2018, with 283,00 more people arriving than leaving - slightly more than a year ago. In total, 627,000 people moved to the UK, while 345,000 people left. But... the figures also show a sharp decline in people moving to the UK from the rest of the European Union, with EU migration hitting its lowest level since 2009. For the eight countries who joined the EU in 2004, including Poland and the Czech Republic, there was a net migration out of the UK. In contrast, migration from the rest of the world hit its highest level since 2004, perhaps because companies and public sector bodies have been scrambling to fill the shortfall. Political analyst Nina Schick tweets: Let\u2019s catch up with the flurry of UK corporate news. Engineering firm Rolls-Royce has pulled out of the race to supply engines to Boeing\u2019s new mid-market planes, as it can\u2019t meet the airline\u2019s timetable. Shares are down 3%, even though RR also beat expectations with a 7% rise in revenues and doubling its core free cash flow. British American Tobacco is also among the top fallers, down 2.8%, despite reporting strong demand for its vaping products. That may be because total sales volumes declined 3.5%. Joinery firm Howdens is also getting a hammering, down 7% after slightly missing expectations and warning that Brexit could hurt its performance (it\u2019s already stocking parts in case of a No Deal crisis But on the other side of the aisle, Rentokil\u2019s shares have surged 5% to the top of the FTSE 100 risers after reporting double-digit increases in revenues and operating profit. Last summer\u2019s heatwave can take some credit, as callouts for pest controllers jumped in the warm weather (excellent breeding conditions for wasps, rats, ants and other creepy crawlies...) Fiona Cincotta of www.cityindex.co.uk blames increased political tensions in Asia (Kashmir, North Korea...) for today\u2019s selloff: An escalation of geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan, to the worst levels since the 1971 war between the two nations has given investors another concern to add to their already long list. Investors showed no signs of wanting to extend the recent rally in equities, with risk instead coming off the table and riskier assets such as equities being sold off. With the US \u2013 North Korean summit also about to begin and with nerves creeping in about how much distance the US and China still need to cover in order to secure a trade deal, investors are preferring to watch from the side-lines. European stock markets are also nursing losses in early trading. Concerns over China\u2019s slowdown, and disappointment that the US-North Korea summit broke up without a deal, has created a cloud of gloom over the City. The FTSE 100 has shed 56 points, or 0.8%, to 7050, its lowest level in over three weeks. Other European indices are also slipping, as the optimism that drove shares up in 2019 fades away. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Donald Trump\u2019s failure to reach a deal with Kim Jong-un, and the lack of a trade deal with China, are disappointing investors. \u201cUS talks with North Korea have broken up without a deal. South Korean shares fell sharply as the meeting broke up, with Asian shares broadly in the red. I don\u2019t think this will ultimately have too much bearing on global indices in the longer term, but for now with hopes of a deal with China on trade not exactly fading, but certainly not rising, it\u2019s 0 from 2 for Trump this week and risk sentiment is suffering as a result. The combination of the lack of progress with North Korea and China will drag on equities and we might have to wait for a new catalyst to renew the bullish start to the year. Asian stock have been hit by China\u2019s weak factory data....and by the sudden break-up of the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jung-un. Hopes of a denuclearisation deal have been dashed, with Trump telling reporters that Kim had demanded all sanctions on North Korea were lifted. The US refused, as Kim wasn\u2019t making enough concessions on dismantling its nuclear facilities. South Korea\u2019s stock market was hit hard, down 1.7%. Japan\u2019s Topix has shed 0.8%. Despite Trump\u2019s overtures to Pyongyang, Kim has not been persuaded to give up his nuclear programme: Commodity prices have been hit by the slump in Chinese exports, with copper and zinc both down around 0.6%. Today\u2019s Chinese factory data really is gloomy: China\u2019s economic slowdown is also hurting the UK. British car exports to China plunged by over 70% in January compared to a year earlier, which (not surprisingly) is the biggest drop ever recorded. It confirms earlier reports of slowing demand for vehicles among Chinese consumers. Overall, UK car production declined by 18% last month, the eighth monthly fall in a row, with weaker demand from the eurozone also hurting. More here: Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING, fears that China\u2019s factories will keep shrinking, unless Beijing and Washington reach a trade agreement. \u201cUnless the trade war truly turns into an extended truce, the weakening trend may not end quickly. As such we expect March\u2019s PMI to fall, too.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Chinese factories have suffering the swiftest drop in export orders since the financial crisis a decade ago, fuelling concerns that the country\u2019s economy has weakened. Fresh economic data show that manufacturing activity in China shrank in February, for the third month running, at the fastest rate in three years. This dragged the official manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) down to just 49.2, from 49.5 in January (any figure below 50 shows a contraction). That\u2019s the weakest reading since February 2016. The sub-index which measures exports was particularly weak, slumping alarmingly to just 45.2 - the lowest since February 2009 when the global economy was deep in recession. This means Chinese exports have fallen for nine month\u2019s running. It\u2019s not all bad news - China\u2019s service sector did grow in February (although at a slower pace). But the deterioration in its manufacturing sector will reinforce concerns that the trade war with America is causing significant damage. That\u2019s a concern, after US trade representative Robert Lighthizer warned Congress yesterday that lots of work still needs to be done to reach a full, workable trade deal. The news disappointed investors, sending the Shanghai composite index down 0.5%. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: As if on cue more weak data poured out of China, pulling the Shanghai composite index lower. Factory activity in China contracted for a third straight month in February as export orders fell to the lowest level since the global crisis. Further evidence of a slowdown in China hit risk sentiment, The realisation that there is still considerable work to be done for the US and China to reach a trade agreement, plus further evidence of economic activity in China slowing is leaving little for traders to cheer on Thursday. Geopolitical angst is also weighing on the markets, as the Kashmir crisis intensifies. The breaking news that the Trump-Kim summit has broken up without an agreement will also disappoint investors. Also coming up today We\u2019ll finally discover how America\u2019s economy fared in the final quarter of 2018, when the delayed GDP figures are released. Economists expect that the annualised growth rate slowed from 3.4% to 2.2% (or to around 0.55% on a quarter/quarter basis). There\u2019s also a flurry of UK company results this morning, with carmaker Aston Martin, theme park group Merlin, housebuilder Bovis, estate agent Foxtons, transport group National Express, insurer RSA, jet engine maker Rolls Royce and airline group IAG all updating the markets.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 1 March \u2013 welcome to autumn. Top stories Scott Morrison will continue his efforts to reboot the Coalition\u2019s energy policy today, by launching public consultations on a national hydrogen strategy. His government will engage the chief scientist Alan Finkel to develop a roadmap with the cooperation of Canberra and the states as part of its policy reset that has seen the prime minister travel to the Snowy Hydro scheme and resurrect Tony Abbott\u2019s \u201cDirect Action\u201d emissions plan. It follows Labor\u2019s commitment to spend $1bn on developing clean hydrogen energy, which is being promoted as a replacement for natural gas and is being used overseas in the transport sector and in electricity generation. Australia has the infrastructure and renewable energy capability to scale the production, Finkel says. Israel\u2019s attorney general intends to indict the country\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in three corruption cases, the Israeli justice ministry has said. The decision comes just six weeks before a general election, and the announcement could severely damage Netanyahu\u2019s chances in a tight race. The charges include bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The country\u2019s second-longest serving PM who runs the most rightwing government in its history, Netanyahu has denied all accusations, dismissing them as part of a witch-hunt orchestrated by the press. He has previously pledged not to resign if indicted and would be under no legal obligation to do so. The New South Wales auditor general has released a damning report into the inability of the state\u2019s gun registry to track ownership and to make decisions about licences. Margaret Crawford\u2019s report says the registry\u2019s owner database was out of date, with 7% of renewal notices being returned every month because they had been sent to the wrong address. In addition, junior staff were often left to make crucial decisions about licence suspensions with the result that more than a quarter of appeals against revocations were successful in the three years to 2016. World Pakistan says it will release a captured Indian pilot as a \u201cpeace gesture\u201d between the neighbours, amid the gravest military crisis in the subcontinent in two decades. The pilot was shot down on Wednesday during a dogfight in the Himalayan foothills, the first between the countries to be publicly acknowledged for 48 years. The Indian pilot, a wing commander identified as Abhi Nandan, appeared in a bloodied uniform as he gave his name and rank in a video released by the Pakistani armed forces. India earlier said one of its air force Mig-21 fighter aircraft has been \u201clost\u201d in an engagement with Pakistani aircraft in the Indian portion of Kashmir and that its pilot was missing. Donald Trump has said he took Kim Jong-un \u201cat his word\u201d when he denied any responsibility in the imprisonment and torture of Otto Warmbier that led to the US student\u2019s death in 2017. \u201cSome really bad things happened to Otto,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut Kim tells me that he didn\u2019t know about it and I will take him at his word.\u201d The second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un has ended in failure, with the two sides far apart on the central issues of disarmament and sanctions relief. The abrupt end to the Hanoi meeting, which was cut short by several hours, was a setback from both leaders, and there are no plans for a third summit. An 11-year old girl who became pregnant after being raped was forced to give birth after Argentinian authorities refused to allow her the abortion to which she was entitled. The authorities ignored repeated requests for an abortion from the child, called \u201cLuc\u00eda\u201d to protect her identity, as well as her mother and a number of Argentinian women\u2019s right activists. YouTube will disable all comments on videos featuring younger children, the company says, in a move designed to stave off an advertiser boycott sparked by the discovery of an organised paedophile ring operating in plain sight on the video-sharing platform. Opinion and analysis The Kimberley is one of the most stunning places in Australia but is has been likened to Syria for the supposed ongoing cycle of trauma being experienced there \u2013 so what is the truth? A caseworker takes us through the court system and what is really going on when a child is committing crimes. \u201cIt is imperative that the link between mental health and crime becomes common knowledge soon,\u201d the anonymous case worker writes. \u201cVictims of crime are growing impatient, and the spectre of retribution lies smouldering in the north\u2019s wet season heat.\u201d There is a reason Scott Morrison has started softening the Coalition\u2019s climate and energy policies: Liberal and National MPs are vulnerable to independent challengers who can appeal to concerns about issues such as climate, water and regional services. Barnaby Joyce in New England and Angus Taylor in Hume are among those facing well-connected local candidates in their seats who could profit as centre-right voters drift towards more typically centre-left issues. Gabrielle Chan speaks to three independents hoping to reach Canberra after the election, and in this week\u2019s politics podcast she shares her thoughts with Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, about why rural voters are deserting the Coalition. Sport The Matildas have begun a new era with a comfortable 2-0 win over New Zealand in the Cup of Nations. Ante Milicic\u2019s first game in charge was victorious, and the new coach chose not to rock the boat, and opted for continuity in players and tactics instead. Emily Gielnik in particular started brightly as most of the Matildas\u2019 forward play came down the right-hand side. As Black History Month comes to an end, African American golfers discuss how much progress the sport has made, why it can still be intimidating and the huge influence of Tiger Woods. Thinking time: \u2018There are consequences for starving a woman\u2019s mind\u2019 Maggie Gyllenhaal made her name in a drama about sadomasochism \u2013 and broke the mould again as a porn director in The Duece. But it\u2019s her hotly debated new film, The Kindergarten Teacher, that might prove to her most transgressive yet. She sits down with the Guardian\u2019s Gwilym Mumford to discuss why there should be consequences for disrespecting women sexually, and why The Kindergarten Teacher serves as a warning on the risks of overlooking a women\u2019s mind and needs. \u201cShe is a woman who is starving, a woman with a vibrant, curious, artistic mind which has not been fed,\u201d Gyllenhaal says of her character Lisa, a teacher who courts an increasingly problematic relationship with a gifted pupil. \u201cI think many women right now in America \u2013 and I imagine it\u2019s the same in the UK \u2013 are waking up to that feeling.

The ranks of public servants continue to grow in Queensland, the Courier-Mail reports, with the average cost of a public servant climbing 12% in five years.

But it is a very close thing.\u201d</p> <p>The ERG has agreed that a group of eight lawyers, seven of them MPs, will scrutinise and pass judgment on the final compromise offered by Geoffrey Cox. Significantly, among them is the DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, whose opinion carries huge weight with Eurosceptic Conservatives on whether to back the prime minister\u2019s deal.</p> <p>Others in the group are the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, and former Department for Exiting the European Union ministers David Jones and Suella Braverman, the veteran Brexiter Bill Cash, and the backbenchers Michael Tomlinson and Robert Courts.

The MP, a long-standing Brexiter and former Ukip candidate, said he wanted to be free to participate in debates in parliament in the coming weeks.</p> <p>In his letter to May, Eustice said he had resigned with \u201ctremendous sadness\u201d and he would vote for May\u2019s withdrawal agreement but said he felt he had \u201cstuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats\u201d.</p> <p>Eustice said he felt the prime minister had been \u201cterribly undermined\u201d by ministers and MPs who did not want to see the referendum result be carried out.</p> <p>\u201cI fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Although he said the prime minister had shown \u201ctenacity and resilience\u201d, he suggested both the prime minister and parliament had lost their nerve. \u201cWhat our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage, and we are about to find out whether parliament has it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Eustice, the MP for Camborne and Redruth, also criticised the conduct of the Brussels negotiators. \u201cI do not believe that the [European] commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThey have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave.</p> <p>\u201cIf the position of parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck.

But it is a very close thing.\u201d The ERG has agreed that a group of eight lawyers, seven of them MPs, will scrutinise and pass judgment on the final compromise offered by Geoffrey Cox. Significantly, among them is the DUP deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, whose opinion carries huge weight with Eurosceptic Conservatives on whether to back the prime minister\u2019s deal. Others in the group are the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, and former Department for Exiting the European Union ministers David Jones and Suella Braverman, the veteran Brexiter Bill Cash, and the backbenchers Michael Tomlinson and Robert Courts. The seven MPs will be joined by Martin Howe QC, chair of the pro-leave group Lawyers for Britain. Number 10 sources suggested it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d any deal would be ready to be brought back to the House of Commons next week, meaning MPs are near certain to vote closer to the deadline of 12 March. Eurosceptic sources said they did not believe a flood of ministerial resignations would follow from Eustice\u2019s departure. The MP, a long-standing Brexiter and former Ukip candidate, said he wanted to be free to participate in debates in parliament in the coming weeks. In his letter to May, Eustice said he had resigned with \u201ctremendous sadness\u201d and he would vote for May\u2019s withdrawal agreement but said he felt he had \u201cstuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats\u201d. Eustice said he felt the prime minister had been \u201cterribly undermined\u201d by ministers and MPs who did not want to see the referendum result be carried out. \u201cI fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country,\u201d he said. Although he said the prime minister had shown \u201ctenacity and resilience\u201d, he suggested both the prime minister and parliament had lost their nerve. \u201cWhat our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage, and we are about to find out whether parliament has it,\u201d he said. Eustice, the MP for Camborne and Redruth, also criticised the conduct of the Brussels negotiators. \u201cI do not believe that the [European] commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. \u201cIf the position of parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door.\u201d Eustice said that MPs should be prepared to vote to leave with no deal and \u201chave the courage, if necessary, to reclaim our freedom first and talk afterwards\u201d. May spoke briefly by telephone with Eustice before his resignation. In her letter to the former minister after is resignation, May called him \u201can outstanding champion for the UK\u2019s farming and fishing communities\u201d. She added: \u201cI agree with you that parliament must now come together and honour the referendum result by voting for a deal which will give businesses and citizens the certainty they need and deserve.\u201d A former farmer who has been a popular figure in the industry, Eustice stood for Ukip in 1999 and worked on the \u201cno\u201d campaign against the euro. He then worked for the Conservative party under Michael Howard, eventually becoming press secretary to David Cameron when he was leader of the opposition.",

He is one of the Brexiter pragmatists - in his letter he says that he accepts the need for compromise, and will vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal - but felt strongly enough about this to leave government.</p> <p>Here are some of the main points from his letter. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/feb/28/brexit-latest-news-developments-mcdonnell-says-theres-chance-labour-could-win-vote-for-second-referendum-politics-live?page=with:block-5c77f405e4b0c5f21366480a#block-5c77f405e4b0c5f21366480a\"> 2.47pm.)</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Eustice claims that allowing article 50 to be extended would lead to \u201chumiliation\u201d for the UK because it would allow the EU to dictate terms.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He says that the UK must be willing to leave the EU with no deal in order to get the best outcome</strong>.

We already know that in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is significant because it reflects a relatively common view amongst Brexiters. But this is not what the EU are saying would happen in the event of no deal. Towards the end of last year, when giving <a href=\"http://www.sipotra.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Oral-evidence-The-progress-of-the-UK%E2%80%99s-negotiations-on-EU-withdrawal-HC-372.pdf\">evidence to the Commons Brexit committee (pdf),<strong> <br></strong></a><strong>Michel Barnier,</strong> the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiators, was asked if there would be informal UK-EU deals in the event of there being no agreement. He replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now if there is a no deal there is no more discussion. There is no more negotiation. It is over and each side will take its own unilateral contingency measures, and we will take them in such areas as aviation, but this does not mean mini-deals in the case of a no deal. We want a deal. We want an overall agreement; otherwise each will take their own contingency measures on their own side. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Eustice claims that parliament is now \u201cin direct control of events\u201d. </strong>This is questionable, because the amendment that would have forced the government to cede control of the parliamentary timetable to allow the Yvette Cooper bill to be debated was never voted on or passed. But Eustice clearly feels that, even though the original Cooper plan was not implemented, it might just as well have been.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He says that he is resigning because he wants to be \u201cfree to participate in the critical debate\u201d coming up. </strong>That implies that he wants to be able to vote against extending article 50 if there is a vote on 14 March (following the defeat of the Brexit deal). That in turn implies that he expects May to whip Tory MPs to vote for extension in those circumstances - something ministers have refused to confirm.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>He accuses the EU of not acting honourably. </strong>He says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave.

Since parliament is now in direct control of events, I want to be free to participate in the critical debate that will take place in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>It has been an honour to work alongside so many talented individuals at Defra over the past five years. Defra has phenomenal expertise and, more than any other government department, has embraced the opportunities posed by our exit from the EU. I have particularly welcomed the chance to craft two new Bills on farming and fisheries, which are the first for half a century, as we have prepared the ground to restore self-government in this country.</p> <p>I will vote for your withdrawal agreement when it returns to the House and I very much hope that the attorney general succeeds in securing final changes so that others might too. Although I campaigned to leave, I have always supported compromise to achieve a reconciliation in our country. Leaving the EU would represent an historic change and it is natural that some people will feel apprehensive. I have been open to the idea of using our existing membership of the EEA as an exit mechanism and I supported your approach outlined at Chequers when others did not. I have stuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats. However, I fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country.</p> <p>I appreciate that you have been terribly undermined by those in parliament who refuse to respect the referendum result. You have shown tenacity and resilience over the past year. However, what our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage, and we are about to find out whether parliament has it.</p> <p>As a Defra Minister, I have enjoyed good relations with the European commission and with ministers from other member states. However, I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. If the position of Parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door.</p> <p>We must therefore have the courage, if necessary, to reclaim our freedom first and talk afterwards. We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too.

The Tory Brexiter David Jones has just asked him if there is any precedent for cabinet ministers openly arguing against government policy, as is happening now.

Here are the main points he made.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Watson said the resignation of Luciana Berger last week was \u201cthe worst day of shame in the Labour Party\u2019s 120-year history\u201d</strong>. He would be meeting Jeremy Corbyn next week to discuss what more could be done to tackle antisemitism in the party. He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve asked to see Jeremy on Monday next week to talk about how we can further improve our measures to deal with antisemitism. </p> <p>When Luciana Berger left the Labour party, I thought it was the worst day of shame in the Labour party\u2019s 120-year history. A pregnant young MP bullied out of her own party by racist thugs. </p> <p>The one thing I say to my colleagues and half a million Labour party members is that I am not going to allow them to be tainted by racism, so I am going to speak out on antisemitism for as long as it takes to root it out and deal with it. There\u2019s individual responsibility here but there\u2019s also collective responsibility on the shadow cabinet and national executive committee to speak out and deal with it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He strongly criticised Chris Williamson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/28/labour-to-push-for-stricter-online-gambling-regulations\">who was suspended from the party yesterday,</a> saying some of Williamson\u2019s comments have been \u201calmost ... deliberately inflammatory\u201d. </strong>Watson said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having monitored some of the things he\u2019s said in the last week, our general secretary decided that the pattern of behaviour over recent months was potentially bringing our party into disrepute, and so has suspended him from the party and there\u2019ll be an inquiry. </p> <p>He\u2019s entitled to a fair hearing but I\u2019ve been very, very concerned that his comments have almost been deliberately inflammatory and causing offence to not just parliamentary colleagues but people in the Jewish community who understandably have a real concern about antisemitism in the Labour party.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he did not know whether or not, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-chris-williamson-antisemitism-labour-mp-video-jewish-abuse-a8800496.html\">as has been claimed</a>, someone from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office argued against Williamson being suspended.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Watson failed to give Corbyn a wholehearted endorsement as a potential prime minister.</strong> When asked if Corbyn was fit to be prime minister, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He could easily be prime minister. </p> <p>But, of course, we could do without the antisemitism because it allows you to ask me that question on the Today programme. We need to close these issues down and we do it by being absolutely vigilant in the way we deal with racism in our own ranks. That\u2019s on all of us.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He confirmed that he wanted to set up a group for Labour MPs from the party\u2019s social democratic wing. </strong>He explained:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For very understandable reasons in the party - to do with the challenge to Jeremy a couple of years ago and some MPs not wanting to serve - we\u2019ve not got a balance of traditions on our front bench. </p> <p>We can handle that, but it does mean there needs to be a different way of making sure that those traditions\u2019 voices are expressed in a different way on policy-making. </p> <p>There\u2019s no big issue about this but I do want the democratic socialist and the Christian socialist and the social democratic traditions to be heard in the parliamentary Labour party - if not on the front bench, to be heard by the front bench.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e08779675941f77092d0e18ce02f3661e9ac1b96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e08779675941f77092d0e18ce02f3661e9ac1b96/0_14_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Watson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Watson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5c77ab63e4b01c747a0e578c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-02-28T09:36:37.202Z\">9.36am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the Commons <strong>Nick Brown</strong>, the Labour chief whip, has just moved the writ for the Newport West byelection, caused by the death of Paul Flynn.

And I think the more we focus on that, the more there\u2019s a chance that either a deal will go through that will protect jobs and the economy, or to get some deal through it will be conditional on going back to the people.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>McDonnell also said that, even though his Hayes and Harlington constituency voted leave, he would vote remain in a second referendum, he would campaign for remain if there were a referendum. He explained: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Yes I would [vote remain] because I did last time. I think it\u2019s the right thing to do. At the same time, I tell you, we\u2019ve got to respect people\u2019s views on this.

      "bodyText": "Agriculture minister George Eustice has resigned from the government over Theresa May\u2019s decision to allow a vote on delaying article 50, saying it would be \u201cthe final humiliation of our country\u201d. Brussels is to insist that any Brexit delay is a one-off, according to senior EU diplomats, setting the stage for Theresa May to present MPs with the choice of her deal or a chaotic no-deal exit this summer. The British government has expressed anger after the EU offered tentative support for Spain\u2019s territorial claim over the land on which Gibraltar airport is built. NHS bosses have urged ministers to scrap controversial legislation that has led to the widespread privatisation of healthcare as part of a major revamp of the health service. Britain launched an economic and diplomatic push to protect Jordan as an oasis of political stability in the Middle East by staging a conference designed to rescue the debt-ridden country, and help its leader, mainly by an injection of private sector investment. The Labour MP David Lammy has denied snubbing Comic Relief after he became embroiled in a dispute with the television journalist and Strictly Come Dancing winner Stacey Dooley. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. A group of Extinction Rebellion climate activists planning to stage a protest during first minister\u2019s questions were stopped by police from entering the Scottish parliament earlier today. Extinction Rebellion Scotland, an offshoot of the now global network of climate protestors, said they planned to interrupt Nicola Sturgeon by challenging her to pursue much more radical, tougher policies to cut carbon emissions. Activists posing as tourists staged an occupation in the Holyrood chamber on Friday 25 January, a non-sitting day, and also a sit-down protest in Parliament Square outside Westminster. Sturgeon insists her government is amongst the world leaders on tackling climate change, but an Extinction Rebellion spokeswoman said: We were intending to stand up during first minister\u2019s questions, and ask \u2018why won\u2019t the Scottish government commit to going carbon neutral by 2025? We call on the Scottish government to tell the truth and act as if the truth was real. A Police Scotland spokesman said: On the morning of Thursday 27th February, officers working at the Scottish parliament had reason to believe that five individuals attempting to enter the Scottish parliament were intent on disrupting parliamentary business. They were refused entry and left the area with no issue. Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, has welcomed George Eustice\u2019s resignation. He says leaving the EU with no deal \u201cmay yet be the best option for the UK\u201d. Here is the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith on George Eustice\u2019s resignation. Here is Michael Gove, the environment secretary, on the resignation of his junior minister and fellow Brexiter George Eustice. Here is Theresa May\u2019s response to George Eustice\u2019s resignation letter. By the standard of these things, it is warm and complimentary. The Russell Group is calling on Sajid Javid to scrap plans for a 36-month visa for EU nationals coming to the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit because it discriminates against Scottish universities, which offer four year degrees. Describing the plans, which would also penalise future EU students wanting to study engineering or medicine courses, which also last longer than three years, as \u201ca kick in the teeth\u201d for Scottish universities, the Russell Group head of policy Jess Cole said: Introducing a non-extendable, three-year visa for EU nationals would be bizarre. It\u2019s a kick in the teeth to Scottish universities, given nearly every undergraduate course in Scotland is four years, and to courses such as medicine and engineering, which are also longer. This makes no sense for the NHS and industry, given the doctors and engineers we need. Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, said: This policy actively discriminates against Scottish universities as our undergraduate degrees are typically four years in length. This is an oversight by the UK government but one which will inflict disproportionate damage to our institutions and must be rectified as a matter of urgency. It\u2019s not quite the Jarrow March, although it follows a similar route \u2013 next month a group of pro-Brexit protesters , led by Nigel Farage, are due to stage a walk from Sunderland to London to \u201cvoice their deep disappointment at the ongoing betrayal of the referendum result\u201d. The event is being organised by Leave Means Leave, whose founder and chair, Richard Tice and John Longworth, will be among the planned \u201ccore group\u201d of marchers who will trek the entire 270 or so miles. Farage, the former Ukip leader who is setting up a new pro-Brexit party, will be there for the start \u2013 Sunderland was chosen as the first city to record a vote for leave in 2016 \u2013 and on yet-to-be-confirmed other legs to be fitted round his \u201cpre-existing commitments\u201d, a spokesman for Leave Means Leave said. The march will end with a rally in Parliament Square on 29 March, the planned Brexit date, though of course it might end up not being then. In a quote released by the organisers, Farage said: The Westminster elite are in the process of betraying the British people over Brexit. All of us who want Britain to be a great country once again accept that we must be prepared to stand up for what we believe in and fight for our independence. The European commission has rejected the UK parliament\u2019s call for a mini deal guaranteeing citizens\u2019 rights in the event of the withdrawal agreement being rejected. Last night the Commons approved without opposition the amendment tabled by the Tory MP Alberto Costa saying the government should ask the EU \u201cto adopt part two of the withdrawal agreement on citizens\u2019 rights ... whatever the outcome of negotiations on other aspects of the withdrawal agreement.\u201d The government originally opposed the amendment, on the grounds that the EU would never agree, although it changed its mind yesterday hours ahead of the vote. And today we\u2019ve discovered that Theresa May\u2019s initial assessment was right; according to the EU, the Costa plan is a non-starter. This is what the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told a Brussels briefing when asked if the EU was willing to strike a deal of the kind proposed by Costa. She replied: We will not negotiate mini-deals because negotiating such mini-deals outside the withdrawal agreement would imply that the negotiations have failed. Andreeva said that the best way to protect the continuing rights of expat citizens was \u201cthrough the withdrawal agreement\u201d. Last night most Tory MPs voted alongside the opposition to back an amendment approving Theresa May\u2019s decision to allow the Commons a possible vote on extending article 50. Dozens of Conservatives abstained, but only 20 voted against. They were all hardline Brexiters, but they were small in number, and they lost the vote by a majority of almost 500. The rebellion seemed contained. But George Eustice\u2019s resignation shows that it is not just the Brexiter ultras who are furious about the prospect of article 50 being extended. He is one of the Brexiter pragmatists - in his letter he says that he accepts the need for compromise, and will vote for Theresa May\u2019s deal - but felt strongly enough about this to leave government. Here are some of the main points from his letter. (See 2.47pm.) Eustice claims that allowing article 50 to be extended would lead to \u201chumiliation\u201d for the UK because it would allow the EU to dictate terms. He says that the UK must be willing to leave the EU with no deal in order to get the best outcome. However, he does not explain in detail exactly how he expects the EU would react to this brinkmanship, or what concessions he thinks they might offer. He claims that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the EU would offer the UK an informal nine-month transition. We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window. This is significant because it reflects a relatively common view amongst Brexiters. But this is not what the EU are saying would happen in the event of no deal. Towards the end of last year, when giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee (pdf), Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiators, was asked if there would be informal UK-EU deals in the event of there being no agreement. He replied: Now if there is a no deal there is no more discussion. There is no more negotiation. It is over and each side will take its own unilateral contingency measures, and we will take them in such areas as aviation, but this does not mean mini-deals in the case of a no deal. We want a deal. We want an overall agreement; otherwise each will take their own contingency measures on their own side. Eustice claims that parliament is now \u201cin direct control of events\u201d. This is questionable, because the amendment that would have forced the government to cede control of the parliamentary timetable to allow the Yvette Cooper bill to be debated was never voted on or passed. But Eustice clearly feels that, even though the original Cooper plan was not implemented, it might just as well have been. He says that he is resigning because he wants to be \u201cfree to participate in the critical debate\u201d coming up. That implies that he wants to be able to vote against extending article 50 if there is a vote on 14 March (following the defeat of the Brexit deal). That in turn implies that he expects May to whip Tory MPs to vote for extension in those circumstances - something ministers have refused to confirm. He accuses the EU of not acting honourably. He says: I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. If the position of parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door. This is from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg on George Eustice\u2019s resignation. To make sense of George Eustice\u2019s resignation, it helps to know that, although he is not the most vocal of the Brexiters in government, he is probably the only one who once stood as a Ukip candidate. That was back in 1999, when he failed to get elected as an MP. He subsequently joined the Conservatives, working for David Cameron as his press secretary when Cameron was opposition leader, before being elected MP for Camborne and Redruth in Cornwall in 2010. Here is the full text of George Eustice\u2019s resignation letter. Here is his resignation letter in full. It is with tremendous sadness that I have decided to resign from the government following the decision this week to allow the postponement of our exit from the EU. Since parliament is now in direct control of events, I want to be free to participate in the critical debate that will take place in the weeks ahead. It has been an honour to work alongside so many talented individuals at Defra over the past five years. Defra has phenomenal expertise and, more than any other government department, has embraced the opportunities posed by our exit from the EU. I have particularly welcomed the chance to craft two new Bills on farming and fisheries, which are the first for half a century, as we have prepared the ground to restore self-government in this country. I will vote for your withdrawal agreement when it returns to the House and I very much hope that the attorney general succeeds in securing final changes so that others might too. Although I campaigned to leave, I have always supported compromise to achieve a reconciliation in our country. Leaving the EU would represent an historic change and it is natural that some people will feel apprehensive. I have been open to the idea of using our existing membership of the EEA as an exit mechanism and I supported your approach outlined at Chequers when others did not. I have stuck with the government through a series of rather undignified retreats. However, I fear that developments this week will lead to a sequence of events culminating in the EU dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country. I appreciate that you have been terribly undermined by those in parliament who refuse to respect the referendum result. You have shown tenacity and resilience over the past year. However, what our country needs from all its political leaders at this critical juncture is courage, and we are about to find out whether parliament has it. As a Defra Minister, I have enjoyed good relations with the European commission and with ministers from other member states. However, I do not believe that the commission has behaved honourably during these negotiations. They have deliberately made progress slow and difficult. They have stated in terms that they will refuse to even hold substantive negotiations on a future partnership until after we leave. If the position of Parliament is now that we will refuse to leave without an agreement then we are somewhat stuck. This is uncomfortable for everyone, but we cannot negotiate a successful Brexit unless we are prepared to walk through the door. We must therefore have the courage, if necessary, to reclaim our freedom first and talk afterwards. We must be ready to face down the European Union here and now. The absence of an agreement poses risks and costs for them too. We already know that in the event of \u201cno deal\u201d the EU will seek an informal transition period for nine months in many areas and settlement talks could continue within this window. I will do what I can from the back benches to try to salvage this sorry situation and I hope that, when the moment comes, Parliament will not let our country down. George Eustice, the Brexiter fisheries minister, has just announced his resignation from the government. He says he is opposed to Theresa May\u2019s decision to allow MPs a vote on extending article 50. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, has moved to quell concerns in Ireland after reports that Britain wanted to start a \u201cbeef trade war\u201d. Downing Street said there was still no firm date for the publication of the schedule of tariffs which was due last week. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, told the Irish parliament that Lidington rang him to tell him he was concerned about the reports over beef wars and \u201cmade it clear to me that they were not coming from the British government\u201d. Coveney told MPs in the Dail there were \u201celements within the Westminster system that are frustrated that they cannot get over this issue of the backstop and want to see some pressure being applied to Ireland.\u201d Ireland is concerned about the prospect of tariffs with around 50% of its Beef exports going to the UK. Government briefings to food sector interests suggest that while tariffs threaten price rises, quotas will be used to counter that in areas such as beef where Britain relies on imports. This would mean little or no price rises on foods like beef and dairy imports. Labour will vote for a second referendum on Brexit when Theresa May tries to get her deal through parliament in the next fortnight, John McDonnell has said. And there is a chance Labour could win the vote, he claimed. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has accused suspended MP Chris Williamson of being \u201cdeliberately inflammatory\u201d over antisemitism in the party, as he pledged to wage a personal battle to regain trust over the issue. Net migration to Britain from the EU has dropped to the lowest level for almost a decade, fuelled by falling numbers of eastern European citizens since the Brexit vote, even as migration from the rest of the world rose. The CBI and the Institute of Directors have expressed concern about the trend. (See 12.11pm.) Scotland could see the size of its workforce fall by up to 5% over two decades as a result of the UK government\u2019s immigration plans, an expert panel advising the Scottish government has said in a report (pdf). Summarising the findings, a Scottish government news release said: The report reveals the harm UK government proposals would have on Scotland, reducing migration by up to 50%, thereby jeopardising Scotland\u2019s economy, public services and future population growth. The advisory group also highlighted the disproportionate impact of the UK government\u2019s proposed salary threshold, under which people earning less than \u00a330,000 would not be allowed admittance to the UK. The group estimated 63% of workers in Scotland currently earn below that level, and that it would exclude a greater proportion of women than men as well as younger people at the start of their career. Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has told MPs that TV adverts explaining the implications of a no-deal Brexit will be broadcast. Giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee, he said: Information [about no deal[ is available. We\u2019ve been putting it out on the website for several months, that\u2019s now been complemented by some radio advertising. We have plans to bring through some television advertising as well. So there is a communications campaign, but of course citizens and businesses are aware of that but they also look at the front pages and the news bulletins and they make a judgment, their own judgments, about the likelihood of no deal on 29 March. Sedwill told the committee that the government will make an announcement about \u201cnew towns\u201d next week. (See 11.04am.) He was speaking in response to a question about reports that the government will increase investment in leave-voting Labour areas, and the move is likely to be seen as part of a bid to encourage Labour MPs to back the government\u2019s Brexit deal. The government is also expected to announce new pledges on workers\u2019 rights next week - another strand of its strategy to win round opposition MPs on Brexit. Sedwill told the committee there was too much leaking from cabinet. He said: Ministers are entitled, and indeed are required, to exercise full candour in debating issues [in cabinet] before a decision is made, and expect to be able to able to do so in confidence. And, of course, the area in my view of collective responsibility that has been under most pressure - I can\u2019t put it quite as well as Peter Bone did yesterday in the House - is the breakdown in the confidentiality of those discussions. That is an issue that we are going to have to address as we work our way through this. The basic salary of an MP will rise by 2.7% from \u00a377,379 from to \u00a379,468 in April, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has announced. And here is some more reaction to the immigration figures. (See 11.06am.) From Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary The data simply confirms the fakery behind the government\u2019s immigration policy. Once again the number of migrants coming here vastly outstrips its unworkable 100,000 net migration target. From Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford The overall story the data tell on EU migration is clear - Britain is not as attractive to EU migrants as it was a couple of years ago. EU net migration happened to be unusually high in the run-up to the referendum so at least some of this decline would probably have happened anyway even without Brexit. From Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: It is a real concern that non-EU net migration has risen still further to more than a quarter of a million even before the government has implemented its proposals to loosen the work permit system. These are from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge in Brussels. Here is some reaction to the migration figures out this morning, showing a sharp fall in net migration from the EU since the referendum, but an increase in net migration from outside the EU. (See 11.06am.) From Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Hospitals, schools and social care providers are already struggling to hire the staff they need, and Brexit is making that problem so much worse. Even before we\u2019ve left the EU, the chaos created by Tory ministers and the nasty rhetoric of Brexiters is putting off the EU workers that our public services badly need. From Matthew Fell, the CBI\u2019s chief UK policy director These figures confirm fewer EU workers are coming to the UK, exacerbating labour and skills shortages across many sectors, from farm labourers to engineers. Businesses cannot succeed without access skills and labour, which is why it\u2019s so important the government delivers a post-Brexit immigration system which is both open and controlled. From Tej Parikh, an economist at the Institute of Directors With job vacancies at record highs, recruiting from abroad has never been more crucial for British businesses. Flexible and hassle-free access to international skillsets is part and parcel of having a globally competitive skills regime, so adjusting to the government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration agenda, with its new restrictions, will present some challenges. Already, firms across the retail, hospitality and construction sectors are facing obstacles as some EU workers are returning home, while it\u2019s also becoming harder to attract labour from Europe amidst the uncertain political climate. From Stephen Clarke, an economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank While UK politicians are seemingly unable to provide any clarity on where Britain is heading post-Brexit, EU migrants are increasingly doing so \u2013 by leaving. EU migration is now at its lowest level in a decade \u2013 a fall that is being driven by fewer EU migrants coming to the UK for work. In contrast, migration from the rest of the world is close to a record high, though many of these migrants are coming to study rather than work. Post-Brexit Britain\u2019s migration system is still to be decided, and is years away from coming into effect. But many areas of the labour market \u2013 particularly firms in high-turnover sectors like hospitality who are reliant on the free movement of EU workers \u2013 are going to have to adjust to lower migration well before the new system is in place. From Prof Jonathan Portes, a fellow at UK in a Changing Europe, an academic network Today\u2019s migration statistics show a continued fall in EU migration \u2013 indeed, comparing today\u2019s data with the most recent labour force statistics, it is very likely that more Europeans are now leaving the UK than are arriving. This undoubtedly reflects the impact of Brexit on the attractiveness of the UK to other Europeans. Chris Williamson, who has been suspended from Labour for saying the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d in response to complaints about antisemitism, has posted a message on Twitter thanking those Labour members who have supported him. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, has told BBC\u2019s Radio 5 Live that the party\u2019s inquiry into Chris Williamson should take \u201cweeks, not months\u201d. In an interview with Emma Barnett, asked how long the investigation should take, he replied: It has to be very quick \u2026 I\u2019m not going to set a date but I do know our general secretary is under a lot of pressure on this ... I would imagine, in order to gather evidence and for him to have his case heard, it\u2019s probably a matter of weeks ... But it\u2019s definitely weeks not months, in my view. Curiously, Watson also insisted that he was not technically Corbyn\u2019s deputy. This may come as a surprise to anyone familiar with his job title but, in response to a question as to whether he was speaking out as Corbyn\u2019s deputy or in his own right (Barnett wanted to know why Corbyn was not giving interviews on Williamson), Watson explained: I\u2019m not actually Jeremy\u2019s deputy. I was elected by 200,000 Labour party members. I have my own mandate and I have a responsibility in light of that, which is why I am speaking out now. The Greek foreign ministry has uploaded a Brexit FAQs website for UK nationals living in the country. The \u201cGreece gets prepared for Brexit\u201d site comes a week after Athens\u2019 leftist government announced that the rights of all UK nationals resident in Greece - estimated at 45,000 - will be fully protected in the event of London crashing out of the EU without a deal. The site lists various FAQs under a picture of the Parthenon and, given the uncertainty, ends with \u201cmore questions ands answers to follow soon!\u201d Net migration from outside the EU has hit the highest level in nearly 15 years, as a post-Brexit plunge in arrivals from the bloc continued, new figures reveal. As the Press Association reports, overall, the balance between the numbers arriving in and leaving the UK remained above 250,000 - nearly three times the government\u2019s target level of below 100,000. Office for National Statistics data showed that 261,000 more non-EU citizens came to the country than left in the year ending September 2018. This was the highest estimate since 2004. EU net migration continued to add to the UK\u2019s population, but it almost halved year-on-year to 57,000 - a level last seen in 2009, the Press Association reports. Overall, around 283,000 more people moved to the UK with an intention to stay 12 months or more than left. At the public administration committee Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has just told MPs that there will be an announcement about \u201cnew towns\u201d next week. He was responding to a question from Labour\u2019s Rupa Huq about reports that the government will increase investment in leave-voting Labour areas, in what is being seen by some as a move to encourage Labour MPs to vote for the government\u2019s Brexit deal. Alberto Costa, the Tory MP forced to resign as a parliamentary aide by Theresa May, has obliquely criticised the government\u2019s sluggish decision to back his EU migrants amendment as \u201cbetter late than never\u201d. Costa, a Scot who served as private parliamentary secretary to Scottish secretary David Mundell before effectively sacked for putting down the unauthorised amendment, robustly defended his actions in an interview with BBC Radio Scotland. He said his amendment, which instructs May to seek European Union guarantees on residency rights for EU migrants living in the UK after Brexit, and vice versa, had unified Westminster\u2019s parties for the first time since the Brexit vote in June 2016. He told Good Morning Scotland: I brought together all wings of my party, the Labour leader and his party, the SNP leader and his party, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, and his party, the Green party, the Welsh nationalists, Lady Herman, the DUP; it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever seen the House of Commons putting their name down to an amendment with full government backing, on a wholly uncontroversial issue. This morning, I\u2019m really pleased. Costa, the MP for South Leicestershire, and a lawyer, refused to discuss the nature of his dismissal, but said he and May had \u201ca full and frank discussion\u201d about his measure after prime minister\u2019s questions. There was significant levels of confusion at Westminster over whether May would endorse his proposal; she eventually did. I made it very clear to her that the whole house was brought together by my amendment; she confirmed she would give full government support, and you know what, all I care about are the rights of five million people. Asked whether he felt he had been a casualty of Brexit chaos, he said: \u201cWell there\u2019s an old idiom of better late than never.\u201d Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. The Tory Brexiter David Jones has just asked him if there is any precedent for cabinet ministers openly arguing against government policy, as is happening now. He was referring to the way three pro-Europeans published a Daily Mail article on Saturday saying the government should rule out a no-deal Brexit. Sedwill appeared to concede that this was unprecedented, saying \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an exact parallel\u201d, although he subsequently said similar issues arose at the time of the Iraq war. He also admitted that there was too much leaking from cabinet. There has been a \u201cbreakdown\u201d in confidentiality, he said. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, was on the Today programme this morning ahead of a speech he will give later on online gambling. My colleague Rob Davies has previewed the speech here. But Watson was also asked about wider Labour issues, particularly antisemitism. Here are the main points he made. Watson said the resignation of Luciana Berger last week was \u201cthe worst day of shame in the Labour Party\u2019s 120-year history\u201d. He would be meeting Jeremy Corbyn next week to discuss what more could be done to tackle antisemitism in the party. He explained: I\u2019ve asked to see Jeremy on Monday next week to talk about how we can further improve our measures to deal with antisemitism. When Luciana Berger left the Labour party, I thought it was the worst day of shame in the Labour party\u2019s 120-year history. A pregnant young MP bullied out of her own party by racist thugs. The one thing I say to my colleagues and half a million Labour party members is that I am not going to allow them to be tainted by racism, so I am going to speak out on antisemitism for as long as it takes to root it out and deal with it. There\u2019s individual responsibility here but there\u2019s also collective responsibility on the shadow cabinet and national executive committee to speak out and deal with it. He strongly criticised Chris Williamson, who was suspended from the party yesterday, saying some of Williamson\u2019s comments have been \u201calmost ... deliberately inflammatory\u201d. Watson said: Having monitored some of the things he\u2019s said in the last week, our general secretary decided that the pattern of behaviour over recent months was potentially bringing our party into disrepute, and so has suspended him from the party and there\u2019ll be an inquiry. He\u2019s entitled to a fair hearing but I\u2019ve been very, very concerned that his comments have almost been deliberately inflammatory and causing offence to not just parliamentary colleagues but people in the Jewish community who understandably have a real concern about antisemitism in the Labour party. He said he did not know whether or not, as has been claimed, someone from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office argued against Williamson being suspended. Watson failed to give Corbyn a wholehearted endorsement as a potential prime minister. When asked if Corbyn was fit to be prime minister, he replied: He could easily be prime minister. But, of course, we could do without the antisemitism because it allows you to ask me that question on the Today programme. We need to close these issues down and we do it by being absolutely vigilant in the way we deal with racism in our own ranks. That\u2019s on all of us. He confirmed that he wanted to set up a group for Labour MPs from the party\u2019s social democratic wing. He explained: For very understandable reasons in the party - to do with the challenge to Jeremy a couple of years ago and some MPs not wanting to serve - we\u2019ve not got a balance of traditions on our front bench. We can handle that, but it does mean there needs to be a different way of making sure that those traditions\u2019 voices are expressed in a different way on policy-making. There\u2019s no big issue about this but I do want the democratic socialist and the Christian socialist and the social democratic traditions to be heard in the parliamentary Labour party - if not on the front bench, to be heard by the front bench. In the Commons Nick Brown, the Labour chief whip, has just moved the writ for the Newport West byelection, caused by the death of Paul Flynn. It is due to take place on Thursday 4 April. After its Brexit amendment was defeated in the Commons last night, Labour is now officially committed to backing a second referendum. That does not mean that Jeremy Corbyn has become a passionate enthusiast for the idea, there are still many in the party who suspect that his office will manoeuvre to sabotage any such people\u2019s vote if it becomes a probability (not least because it would be hugely divisive), and there is no evidence that, even with Labour whipping its MPs, there is a majority for referendum legislation in the Commons. Still, David Cameron (if we believe Donald Tusk) and Nick Clegg (see here) are both available to give Corbyn some advice on what can happen when you back a referendum expecting it to never happen. And last night John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said there was a chance Labour could win a vote on a second referendum soon. In recent weeks McDonnell has become much more positive about the case for a second referendum than Corbyn and this is what he told ITV\u2019s Peston programme. When the meaningful vote comes back, and we\u2019re told maybe that might be March 12, that\u2019s the time when we\u2019ll have to put the [second referendum] amendment up. Let me just say, we\u2019re still going to argue we want a general election, we\u2019re still going to argue we think our deal that we put up is the best option, but we realise, we\u2019ve got to break this deadlock. We\u2019ve said we\u2019ll keep all the options on the table because we still want a general election. Things are shifting. There is a chance we could win it, and I\u2019ll tell you why. It\u2019s because people are worried about their constituencies, they\u2019re worried about jobs, they\u2019re worried about the economy. And I think the more we focus on that, the more there\u2019s a chance that either a deal will go through that will protect jobs and the economy, or to get some deal through it will be conditional on going back to the people. McDonnell also said that, even though his Hayes and Harlington constituency voted leave, he would vote remain in a second referendum, he would campaign for remain if there were a referendum. He explained: Yes I would [vote remain] because I did last time. I think it\u2019s the right thing to do. At the same time, I tell you, we\u2019ve got to respect people\u2019s views on this. My constituency voted leave, and I am going back all the time and explaining to the people in my constituency, this is why I\u2019ve come to this conclusion. Almost I\u2019ve been forced to. We\u2019ve gone through every path, there\u2019s been no deal that\u2019s been brought forward that is acceptable to parliament at the moment that would protect their jobs and their livelihoods, so we\u2019ve been forced into this situation where there\u2019s no other route that we can see other than this. After the vote last night Jeremy Corbyn himself also released a statement saying that the party would now \u201cback a public vote in order to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit or a disastrous no deal outcome\u201d. But he included a caveat, adding: We will also continue to push for the other available options to prevent those outcomes, including a close economic relationship based on our credible alternative plan or a general election. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 10am: Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the Commons public administration committee. 10.40am: Tom Watson, the Labour deputy leader and shadow culture secretary, gives a speech on online gambling. 4.30pm: Theresa May speaks at the end of the Jordan: Growth and Opportunity Conference, following talks with Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah in Downing Street earlier. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on Brexit. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another when I finish, at around 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply ATL, although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Brussels is to insist that any Brexit delay is a one-off, according to senior EU diplomats, setting the stage for Theresa May to present MPs with the choice of her deal or a chaotic no-deal exit this summer. The prime minister has suggested that she will seek a two-month extension if MPs vote down her deal again in mid-March to allow further time for negotiations. But EU27 heads of state and government are said by senior sources to hate the idea of the UK then asking for a further delay when the initial extension proves to be insufficient for renegotiations. Key member states are understood to be planning to put pressure on the European council president, Donald Tusk, to rule out a second extension in writing. \u201cSome member states will insist on that being on paper,\u201d said one diplomat. May is expected to put her deal to the Commons again on 12 March, and then seek an extension of article 50 if it fails to pass. Diplomats say EU27 leaders will not want to discuss the length or terms of the delay when they meet for a European council summit on 21 March but merely sign off a mandated extension request made by May in the nine days after the vote. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he would only agree to an extension, which would require unanimity of the EU27 leaders, if there was a clear purpose to it. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, told reporters at a joint press conference with the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Vienna on Thursday: \u201cIf this extension should take place it is also necessary to ask the question: what is the goal for the time frame, what good does this extension do? Does it ensure that we will be able to finish all the work? But if this is the way out to prevent a hard Brexit then we will support this path.\u201d May is understood to have beentold during recent discussions with Tusk and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, that the Commons vote on 12 March, should provide a clear path as to how the deal could be saved even if the meaningful note is lost. \u201cA short extension without a mandate, or something from Westminster, will be very difficult,\u201d one EU diplomat said. \u201cIf Westminster is not able to say anything, I don\u2019t think the European council will buy it. What the European council will try to avoid is a discussion at the European council. \u201cShe has to pose the right question to get the right answer. There are two schools of thought, one is that a short extension will be a short jump that will precede another extension, and this is something people hate, politically and even from a purely administrative point of view. So others say it is better to have a long extension.\u201d Some senior EU officials and diplomats are pushing the idea of a 21-month extension, which would delay Brexit until 2021, to allow plans for the future relationship to develop, and for there even to be a change of personnel in Downing Street. There is, however, also resistance among member states who fear the EU will be blamed for trapping the UK in the bloc. \u201cIt is like playing the kingmaker, it isn\u2019t sensible to intervene in domestic politics like that,\u201d said one sceptic of the idea. A delegation of Dutch MPs, which recently visited Westminster to examine the most probable outcome of the Brexit impasse, reported to their parliament that a no-deal scenario appeared likely. They said British MPs were \u201cunable to reach agreement let alone make a proposal\u201d to unlock the talks.",

China controls another part in the east.<br></p>\n    <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did the dispute start?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \u2018princely states\u2019 across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.</p>\n    <p>Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.</p>\n    <p>In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.</p>\n    <p>In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Kashmir\u2019s special status?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kashmir\u2019s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.</p>\n    <p>The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.</p>\n    <p>On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir\u2019s special status. The government argued that the provision had&nbsp; only ever intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan \u2013 which quickly called India\u2019s actions illegal \u2013 and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do the militants want?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.<br></p>\n    <p>Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/india-crackdown-in-kashmir-is-this-worlds-first-mass-blinding\">extreme force</a>&nbsp;in 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.</p>\n    <p>For Indians, control of Kashmir \u2013 part of the country\u2019s only Muslim-majority state \u2013 has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. <br><b><br>Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>India has rallied France, the UK and the US behind a fresh proposal to have the UN security council add Masood Azhar, the head of Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), to a terrorist watchlist.</p> \n<p>JeM claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Kashmir on 14 February that killed 40 Indian paramilitaries and triggered the current crisis.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Kim \u2018demanded all sanctions lifted\u2019 before denuclearisation The much-heralded second summit between Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, ended early and abruptly after an apparent disagreement over sanctions. At a press conference in Hanoi on Thursday, Trump told reporters the North Korean delegation had demanded the lifting of international sanctions \u201cin their entirety\u201d in return for a partial dismantling of the country\u2019s nuclear infrastructure. \u201cThey were willing to denuke a large portion of the areas we wanted but we couldn\u2019t give up all the sanctions for that,\u201d Trump said. As yet, there are no plans for a third summit. Theatrical reboot. Expectations for the talks were always low, with few expecting a final deal on denuclearisation. There had been some hope, however, that the meeting in Vietnam might lead to a declaration that the Korean war is finally over. \u2018Great leader\u2019. Trump continued to praise Kim in Hanoi, describing the brutal authoritarian as a \u201cgreat leader\u201d and \u201cquite a character\u201d. Cohen allegations portend legal and political peril for Trump During more than seven hours of explosive testimony before the House oversight committee on Wednesday, the lawyer, fixer and convicted felon Michael Cohen dropped a series of bombshells with the potential to sink the Trump presidency. Describing his former client as a \u201cracist,\u201d a \u201cconman,\u201d and a \u201ccheat\u201d, Cohen accused the president of knowing in advance about key events under investigation in the Russia inquiry \u2013 including the infamous \u201cTrump Tower meeting\u201d \u2013 and of committing criminal conspiracy in the alleged cover up of his affair with an adult film star. Both claims could leave Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr, in legal jeopardy. Damning portrait. In a story that reflects the extent of Trump\u2019s vanity, Cohen claimed his former boss used a straw bidder and $60,000 from the Trump Foundation to purchase a portrait of himself at an art auction in 2013, ensuring the painting fetched the highest price at the event. Key takeaways. Ed Pilkington breaks down the significant moments from Cohen\u2019s testimony, which included the revelation that the southern district of New York is still pursuing further, as-yet-undisclosed lines of inquiry into Trump\u2019s affairs. NRA faces \u2018growing storm\u2019 as House passes gun legislation The House of Representatives has passed its first major piece of gun legislation for almost a quarter of a century, approving by 240 votes to 190 a measure requiring federal background checks for all firearms sales.

Its spending on the 2018 midterms was $9.4m, roughly a third of the $27m it spent during the 2014 cycle. Crib sheet A Gallup poll measuring global opinion has found the US almost neck and neck with Russia for the first time in terms of confidence in their international leadership, with both countries lagging behind China. Justin Trudeau has dismissed calls for him to resign after his former attorney general accused the Canadian prime minister\u2019s officials of a sustained effort to dissuade her from prosecuting a major engineering company accused of bribery. Pakistan has agreed to release the captured Indian fighter pilot as a \u201cpeace gesture\u201d after he was seized when his plane was shot down amid rising hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours over the disputed Kashmir region. The EU has accused Facebook of repeatedly withholding data detailing its supposed efforts to combat online disinformation ahead of this year\u2019s European elections.

      "bodyText": "India has called for the safe and immediate return of a fighter pilot seized by Pakistan after being shot down during tit-for-tat incursions over Kashmir that have edged the pair closer to war than at any point in the past 20 years. Its pilot, a wing commander identified as Abhi Nandan, appeared in a bloodied uniform as he gave his name and rank in a video released by the Pakistani armed forces. Asked by his interrogator to say more, he replied: \u201cI am sorry, sir, that\u2019s all I\u2019m supposed to tell you.\u201d Delhi said it \u201cstrongly objected to Pakistan\u2019s vulgar display of an injured personnel of the Indian air force in violation of all norms of international humanitarian law\u201d. The external affairs ministry said it had summoned the acting high commissioner of Pakistan, Syed Haider Shah, and lodged a strong protest at the violation of the Indian air space by Pakistan and the targeting of Indian military posts. India earlier said one of its air force Mig-21 fighter aircraft has been \u201clost\u201d in an engagement with Pakistani aircraft in the Indian portion of Kashmir and that its pilot was missing. Pakistan earlier said it shot down two Indian planes and captured two pilots, but later retracted that claim. By Wednesday evening, India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had yet to comment publicly on the fighting but was meeting military chiefs at his residence in Delhi. Meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, appealed for talks, making reference to both countries\u2019 nuclear arsenals. Khan said in a televised address after the airstrikes that the time had come for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. \u201cWith the weapons you have and the weapons we have, can we afford miscalculation? Shouldn\u2019t we think that if this escalates, what will it lead to?\u201d The dogfights on Wednesday morning were the first between the two air forces to be publicly acknowledged since 1971, and triggered the closure of every commercial airport in Pakistan and at least eight in India. Pakistan also closed its airspace, forcing international flights to be rerouted. Footage of the captured pilot, including one video showing him being beaten by a crowd of angry civilians, made the rounds of WhatsApp and social media in India, fuelling popular concern and anger. The pilot said in a video released later by the Pakistani military that its soldiers had \u201crescued me from the mob\u201d, and he was shown sipping tea. Srinagar, the Indian-controlled capital of the Kashmir region that both countries claim in full, appeared to be preparing for war. Its army headquarters observed a blackout overnight as Indian jets patrolled over the city. On Wednesday afternoon, a red cross was painted on the roof of its largest hospital, marking out the building as a medical facility from above. In supermarkets in the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Islamabad, people were stockpiling groceries, while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province the leave of all police and health workers was cancelled. Russia, the US and the UK were among the countries calling for restraint amid fears that the region was trapped in a cycle of escalating attacks. A Pakistan-based militant group killed 40 Indian paramilitaries in a suicide bombing in Kashmir two weeks ago. Indian jets bombed what they claimed were militant training camps in Pakistan on Tuesday morning in response, triggering Wednesday\u2019s reprisal by Pakistan. Khan said the latest airstrikes were deployed from inside Pakistan-held territory and deliberately aimed at empty fields to send a message. \u201cIt was our plan that there should be no collateral damage, no casualties,\u201d he said in his televised address. \u201cWe just wanted to tell India that we have the capability that if you can come into our country, then we can also go into your country and carry out an operation.\u201d But India rejected his account of the operation. \u201c[Pakistan] used its air force to target a military installation on the Indian side,\u201d the spokesman for India\u2019s foreign ministry, Raveesh Kumar, told journalists in Delhi. Islamabad initially said it had captured two Indian pilots, but by Wednesday evening it had retracted the claim. Delhi also claimed to have shot down a Pakistani jet, which it said had crashed on the Pakistani side of the border. The US has played a mediating role in previous escalations of conflict between the neighbours, but on Wednesday Pakistan\u2019s ambassador in Washington said the Trump administration\u2019s failure to condemn the Indian airstrike had contributed to the tension. Asad Majeed Khan said the US response was \u201cconstrued and understood as an endorsement of the Indian position \u2013 and that is what emboldened them even more\u201d. The standoff between the two countries is heightened by India\u2019s looming national elections starting in April. For Pakistan, the driving need is to show its more powerful neighbour that it cannot be pushed around. Arun Sahgal, a retired Indian army brigadier turned policy analyst, said he believed both countries would walk back from the brink. \u201cThe events of today indicate a satisfied Pakistani appetite for retaliation,\u201d the Delhi Policy Group senior fellow said. \u201cBoth countries have lost an aircraft each so there is a degree of equivalence. And from a political perspective, the Indian prime minister [Narendra Modi] has come out looking like a decisive leader. So there is nothing more to achieve.\u201d But the mechanics of drawing down the conflict were another issue and fraught with their own risks, Sahgal said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the international community must play some backchannel diplomacy that pushes the two sides together.\u201d Nandan, the first Indian fighter pilot captured by Pakistan since a 1999 war between the countries, said in the video released by the Pakistani military that he was being treated well. The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he was involved in a round-the-clock effort to prevent the crisis from deepening. He said: \u201cNeither side wants this to escalate. But because of the historic lack of trust between the two countries, it\u2019s a very volatile situation. You don\u2019t have just the governments, but you have public opinion in both countries that is very inflamed. We are urging [both Pakistan and India] to show restraint to stop this situation from deteriorating.\u201d",
