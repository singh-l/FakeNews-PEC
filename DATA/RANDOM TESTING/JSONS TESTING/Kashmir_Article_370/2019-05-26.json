Their mythology and godmen, ideas and heroes are not children of this soil.\u201d The modern Hindu nationalist movement has evolved from Savarkar\u2019s views, said Rajat Sethi, a fellow at the India Foundation, a thinktank aligned with the right-wing Hindu umbrella group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), of which Modi is a lifelong member. \u201cSavarkar talks about a more militarised Hinduism \u2026 The RSS would say, no, it\u2019s about culture,\u201d Sethi said. \u201cHinduism is a community based on shared culture practices rather than a dogmatic book.\u201d In this way, he said, Muslims and Christians were also Hindus: their lifestyles and rituals also inflected by India\u2019s Hindu civilisation. \u201cMuslims form an integral part [of the nation] because a lot of what we stand for is incomplete without Muslims as a religion.\u201d The ostensibly \u201csecular\u201d politics of Nehru\u2019s Congress was really a byword for courting Muslim votes by giving the community special privileges, he added, such as political autonomy for Kashmir, and the right to govern marriages and other social affairs according to Islamic law \u2013 both of which Hindu nationalist groups target for reform. Nehru\u2019s vision now appears to be in terminal decline. The Hindu nationalism he tried to sideline, including by banning the RSS, has been granted a clear popular endorsement. Its worst excesses may be borne by the poor, but wealth and privilege are no shield, said Erum, who researched her book by interviewing more than a hundred children and their parents at some of the most elite schools. \u201cIt\u2019s happening in classrooms, in playgrounds: kids are bullied on religious lines, they are reflecting the fractures in our society,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening in the best schools, the most metropolitan cities. This is no longer the fringe.\u201d She blames in part the country\u2019s 24-hour news channels, which, along with social media, fixate on divisive issues that draw eyeballs but promote a vision of a country in perpetual argument. \u201cIt is an unending culture war,\u201d she said. \u201cGrowing up in India was one of the best experiences,\u201d she added. \u201cReligion was not a factor you considered when you played or shared tiffins. But now it is.\u201d",
